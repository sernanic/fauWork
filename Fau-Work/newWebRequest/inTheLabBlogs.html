                        </a>
                        <p>By Ania Knapinska, Ph.D.</p>
                

                        <p>
                            Ania Knapinska, Ph.D., brings a wealth of experience, talent and dedication to her multiple professional roles. She is a
                            research professor in molecular pharmacology in the departments of chemistry and biochemistry, an associate director of
                            the Center of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, and CEO of MMP Biopharma Inc., a company she co-founded with Gregg
                            Fields, Ph.D., executive director of the FAU Institute for Human Health and Disease Intervention (I-Health). <br/> <br/>
                            
                            Since its creation in 2017, MMP Biopharma has focused on finding novel therapeutic strategies for people with diseases
                            characterized by the degradation of collagen, such as osteoarthritis. There is currently no cure for this painful joint
                            condition, which is the leading cause of knee and hip replacements. MMP Biopharma is building upon knowledge gained
                            through the Fields laboratory’s osteoarthritis project, which Knapinska has overseen for seven years. An exciting
                            breakthrough came when FAU researchers discovered a molecule with the ability to inhibit a crucial enzyme that causes
                            cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis. <br/> <br/>
                            
                            Knapinska is also a co-founder of Deep Science (along with Silke Dodel, Ph.D., a visiting assistant professor in the
                            Charles E. Schmidt College of Science), a startup that develops artificial intelligence and cognitive computing
                            solutions to generate actionable insight from biomedical and healthcare data. Deep Science helps to accelerate progress
                            in the biomedical sciences by helping clients conquer information overload and leverage biological complexity. <br/> <br/>
                            
                            Both companies have achieved recognition in the annual FAU Tech Runway competition for start-up assistance for promising
                            new enterprises. MMP won a spot in Venture Class 5 and Deep Science in Venture Class 7. <br/> <br/>
                             <br/>
                            Knapinska holds a bachelor’s degree in biotechnology from FAU and a Ph.D. in molecular pharmacology from Rutgers
                            University, where she was a National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT)
                            fellow. IGERT is the National Science Foundation’s flagship interdisciplinary training program. <br/> <br/>
                            
                            Prior to joining FAU’s research faculty in 2015, Knapinska was a senior scientist and laboratory manager at the Torrey
                            Pines Institute for Molecular Studies and a research associate at Scripps Florida. She has authored or co-authored many
                            articles in peer-reviewed journals. <br/> <br/>
                            
                            Knapinska is fluent in English, Polish and Spanish. <br/> <br/>
                            
                            Here is more information about her, in her own words: <br/> <br/>

                                            I became a scientist because I wanted to help millions of people. I also have passion for creative and detective work.
                                            Developing drugs for diseases affecting people’s health really combines all these passions.

                                            During my undergraduate studies Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu (who is still a professor at FAU) taught a very interesting
                                            lab-based biotechnology course. I was already getting interested in science at that time, but she inspired me to pursue
                                            science full-time. I really appreciated her passion for teaching and encouraging students.

                                                FAU delivers a great platform for research by providing excellent lab facilities, access to graduate and undergraduate
                                                students and facilitating intra-institutional and interdisciplinary research interactions. Over the last few years, we
                                                have seen more and more support for research, and it is exciting to be taking part in this research “revolution.” The
                                                presence of the Tech Runway Program, modeled after the world-class MIT program, gives hugely needed support and
                                                encouragement to take our research and inventions into real-world application. <br/>
                                                
                                                This extraordinary program gives FAU researchers a big advantage over other institutions by providing mentorship,
                                                business training and an entrepreneurship hub. In addition, the proximity to Scripps Florida and Max Planck Institutes
                                                in Jupiter gives us a huge advantage to be able to collaborate with other world-class researchers, stimulating new ideas
                                                and research directions.

                                            It takes a lot of dedication to pursue career in research. However, a multitude of directions can be pursued after a

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
