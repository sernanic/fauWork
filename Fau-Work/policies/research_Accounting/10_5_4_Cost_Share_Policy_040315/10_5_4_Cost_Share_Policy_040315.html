        <h2><u>General Statement</u> </h2>
        <p>Cost Sharing or matching is the portion of the total sponsored project costs that is not reimbursed by the
            sponsor. Cost sharing represents a commitment by the University or Third- Party (non-federal source) to a
            sponsored project in the form of dollars, effort, or in-kind contribution.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <h2><u>Purpose</u> </h2>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish procedures for Federal and Non-Federal sponsored projects and
            ensure that cost sharing requirements of sponsored programs are proposed, accounted for, and reported in a
            manner consistent with requirements set forth in federal regulations, Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
            Circular A-110 (2 CFR, Part 215) Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with
            Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations, OMB Circular A-21 (2 CFR,
            Part 220) Cost Principles for Educational Institutions, Cost Accounting Standards and Non-Federal sponsor
            guidelines (if applicable).</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <h2><u>Background</u> </h2>
        <p>Cost sharing typically requires the use of institutional funds and places a burden on the University and
            departmental resources. Once an award is made, ALL proposed cost sharing commitments are considered to be
            mandatory and represent binding obligations by the University regardless of whether cost sharing is mandated
            by the sponsor or voluntarily offered by the principal investigator.</p>
        
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <h2><u>Types of Cost Sharing</u> </h2>
        <p>Mandatory Cost Sharing is required by the sponsor as a condition of the award, as stated in the solicitation,
            program announcement, or RFP (Request for Proposal). Failure to include mandatory cost share in a proposal
            makes the application ineligible for an award.</p>
        <p>Voluntary Committed Cost Sharing is cost share proposed by the University when it is not a specific
            requirement of the sponsor. When an award is received where there has been proposed voluntary committed cost
            sharing, the cost sharing becomes a binding commitment that the University must provide as part of the
            performance of the sponsored agreement.</p>
        <p>Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing is not required by the sponsor as a condition of the award and is not
            committed in the proposal budget. It is typically the PI&rsquo;s or other key researcher&rsquo;s effort that
            is over and above the effort committed and budgeted for in a sponsored agreement. Voluntary uncommitted cost
            sharing does not have to be documented.</p>
        <p>University cost sharing
                commitment in the form of &ldquo;effort&rdquo; is discussed in detail in the Cost Sharing FAQs <a

        <h2><u>Policy</u> </h2>
        <p>It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University to include only mandatory cost sharing in proposals submitted
            to sponsors. If cost sharing is not required by the sponsor or necessary for the completion of the project,
            then principal investigators should not make such commitments.</p>
        <p>Mandatory and voluntary cost sharing must be documented in an Institutional Contribution
                Statement<a href="http://www.fau.edu/research/docs/forms/sponsoredprogs/institutional_contribution.xls"
                target="_blank"> http://www.fau.edu/research/docs/forms/sponsoredprogs/institutional_contribution.xls</a> that
            is reviewed and approved by Department Chair, College Dean, Sponsored Programs, Foundation ( if applicable),
            and Provost/Campus VP (if applicable) prior to the proposal being submitted to the sponsor. Upon acceptance
            of the award a unique cost sharing account will be set up to document and report cost sharing expenditures
            for each project. Tracking, reporting and certifying of cost sharing are subject to audit.</p>
        <p>Proposals should clearly state the amount of effort and/or equivalent salary committed by the PI or key
            personnel who have a significant role in meeting the objectives of a sponsored project.</p>
        <p>Principal Investigators and key personnel should request full salary support for the effort that they expect
            to expend in meeting the objectives of the project. However, FAU requires PI or key personnel to commit a
            minimum 1% effort during the award period When the PI&rsquo;s or key personnel&rsquo;s effort is committed
            in the proposal and the related salary is <u>not</u> directly charged to</p>
        <p>the sponsored project, then the effort committed must be treated and documented as cost sharing.</p>
        <p>The minimum 1% effort requirement for the PI or key personnel does not apply to</p>
        <ul>

                <p>Tuition waivers can be offered in a proposal as cost sharing, if allowable by the sponsor. Tuition
                    allowance must be proportionate to the effort of the student on the grant during the applicable
                    semester (.e.g., If a student is working 10 hours on grant A and 10 hours on grant B, then the
                    tuition waivers should be 50% for grant A and 50% for grant B). Tuition waivers will be documented
                    with a Cost Share Certification Form and supporting tuition information.</p>

                    and University&rsquo;s cost sharing contribution on a pro rata basis. Otherwise, the sponsor&rsquo;s

        <h2><u>Definitions</u> </h2>
        <p><u>Cost Sharing</u> is the portion of the total sponsored project costs that is not reimbursed by the sponsor. Cost
            sharing represents a commitment by the University or Third-Party (non-federal source) to a sponsored project
            in the form of dollars, effort, or in-kind contribution.</p>
        <p>Cost Share Obligation is the amount of cost share that must be met and documented by the end of the project
            period. It is equal to the larger of</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The amount of cost share required in the award document and approved budget.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The amount of cost share included in the proposal budget, as either mandatory or voluntary committed
                    cost share.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><u>Direct Costs</u> are costs that can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project with a high degree of
                accuracy. Direct costs are reasonable and necessary to accomplish the project&rsquo;s objectives. Direct
                costs include salaries, fringe benefits, travel, supplies, equipment, tuition and subcontracts. For more
                information see<a href="http://www.fau.edu/research/docs/policies/researchacct/direct_cost.pdf"

        <p><u>Institutional Contribution Statement (ICS)</u>  is an internal FAU document submitted with the proposal by
            principal investigator to Sponsored Programs to document any mandatory or voluntary cost share that will be
            committed by FAU. ICS must be reviewed and approved by Department Chair, College Dean, Foundation ( when
            cost share funding is contributed from a foundation account), Sponsored Programs and Provost/Campus VP (
            when cost share funding is contributed from Provost/Campus VP) prior to proposal being submitted to the
            sponsor.</p>

        <p><u>Letter of Commitment</u>  is a letter from a third party signed by an authorized representative of the entity
            endorsing and quantifying the contribution to the project at the time of the proposal. This document must be
            submitted to Sponsored Programs with the proposal and Institutional Contribution Statement when the project
            involves cost sharing support from a third party outside FAU. Refer to policy statement above and Cost
            Sharing FAQs</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.fau.edu/research/researchacct/acctfaqs.php"
                target="_blank">http://www.fau.edu/research/researchacct/acctfaqs.php</a> for the requirements in
            determining the value of the third-party in-kind contribution.</p>
        <p><u>Leveraging / Other Support</u>  are other programs which are related to the proposed activity that have separate
            scopes of work, separate performance periods, and separate budgets.</p>
        <p>Leveraging is not cost sharing, since cost sharing involves sharing the costs on a single project, with one
            scope of work, one performance period and one budget. Principal Investigators should not characterize
            &ldquo;leveraging&rdquo; or &ldquo;other support&rdquo; as cost sharing in the proposal. National Science
            Foundation (NSF) refers to leveraging as &ldquo;Current and Pending Support.&rdquo; See definition below of
            &ldquo;Other Significant Contributors,&rdquo; which is used in National Institute of Health grants.</p>
        <p><u> Mandatory Cost Sharing</u> is required by the sponsor as a condition of the award, as stated in the solicitation,
            program announcement, or RFP (Request for Proposal). Failure to include mandatory cost share in a proposal
            makes the application ineligible for an award.</p>
        <p><u>Matching Contribution</u>  is cost share required by statute generally specified as a percentage of the project
            costs, in order to be eligible for the sponsor&rsquo;s funding. This requirement may be stated as a
            specified or minimum percentage of total allowable costs or a maximum sponsor percentage of participation of
            such costs. For example, &ldquo;the applicant must provide an amount equal to the sponsor&rsquo;s funds
            &ndash; a 50% or 1:1 match.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;the applicant must provide 20% of total project costs; the
            sponsor will provide funds not to exceed 80% of the total project costs.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><u>OMB Circular A-21 (2 CFR, Part 220)</u>  Cost Principles for Educational Institutions provides guidelines on the allowability of
                costs for federal awards received by universities. Section J General Provisions for Selected Items of
                Cost lists different costs items and states whether they are allowable or unallowable costs on federal
                awards. This document also includes the Cost Accounting Standards that are applicable to educational
                institutions. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a021_2004"

                Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education,
                Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations sets standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity
                among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher
                education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations.<a

        <p><u>Other Significant Contributors</u>  is used by National Institute of Health (NIH) and refers to individuals who
            have committed to contribute to the scientific development or execution of the project, but are not
            committing any specified measurable effort to the project. These individuals are typically presented at zero
            effort or as needed. Individuals with measurable effort cannot be listed as &ldquo;Other Significant
            Contributors.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><u>Third-Party In-Kind Contribution</u>  is a contribution to a sponsored project provided by a party other than FAU or the
                primary sponsoring agency. The basis value of contribution must be established at the time of the
                proposal and documented at the post award stages. Refer to policy statement above and Cost Sharing FAQs
           <a href="http://www.fau.edu/research/researchacct/acctfaqs.php"
                target="_blank">http://www.fau.edu/research/researchacct/acctfaqs.</a>php for the requirements in
            determining the value of the third-party in-kind contribution.</p>
        <p><u>Unrecovered Indirect Costs</u>  is the difference between the F&amp;A rate (indirect cost rate) approved by
            FAU&rsquo;s cognizant audit agency (DHHS) and the F&amp;A rate (indirect cost rate) that the sponsor will
            allow. The difference, also known as the foregone indirect, may be used as cost share only if unrecovered
            indirect cost is explicitly approved by the sponsor. In addition, unrecovered indirect costs applicable to
            cost-shared salaries &amp; benefits, OPS and expenses items may be allowed if explicitly approved by the
            sponsor.</p>
        <p><u>Voluntary Committed Cost Sharing</u>  is cost share proposed by the University when it is not a specific
            requirement of the sponsor. When an award that proposed cost sharing is received, the cost sharing
            obligation becomes a binding commitment that the University must provide as part of the performance of the
            sponsored agreement.</p>
        <p><u>Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing</u>  is not required by the sponsor as a condition for the award and is not
            committed in the proposal budget. It is typically the PI&rsquo;s or other senior researcher&rsquo;s effort
            which is over and above that which is committed and budgeted for in a sponsored agreement. Voluntary
            uncommitted cost sharing does not have to be documented.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
