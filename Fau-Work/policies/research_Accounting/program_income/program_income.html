                                    <p>Rules for Allowability: The Program Income funds must follow the same rules for

                            <p>OMB Circular A-110, Section 24 states that Program Income will be used (spent) in one of
                                the following ways:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding agency and
                                        recipient and used to
                                        further eligible project or program objectives.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net
                                        allowable costs on
                                        which the Federal share of costs is based.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>FAU interprets OMB Circular A-110 to mean that the Program Income will be spent and
                                administered by applying
                                one of the following approaches:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The Additive Approach: Program Income is added to the project budget to further
                                        project or program
                                        objectives. The amount of Program Income increases the amount available for the
                                        PI to accomplish the
                                        scope of work of the project.</p>
                                    <p>For example, if the amount awarded by the sponsor is $100,000 and the project
                                        generates Program
                                        Income from conference registration fees in the amount of</p>
                                    <p>$5,000, the amount available for the project is $105,000. The Program Income
                                        generated will be
                                        accounted for in a separate Banner Fund and the funding from the sponsor will be
                                        accounted for in a
                                        separate Banner Fund.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The Cost Share / Matching Approach: Program Income earned is used to finance the
                                        Non-Federal share of
                                        the project or program.</p>
                                    <p>For example, FAU receives an award from a Federal sponsor in the amount of</p>
                                    <p>$50,000. The sponsor requires a matching amount from FAU of $10,000. The sponsor
                                        allows Program
                                        Income to be used to meet the matching requirement. In the example, the project
                                        generates Program
                                        Income in the amount of $10,000. This</p>
                                    <p>$10,000 in Program Income is accounted for in a separate Banner Fund. The</p>
                                    <p>$50,000 from the sponsor is accounted for in a separate Banner Fund. The entire
                                    </p>
                                    <p>$10,000 in Program Income is spent on the project. FAU has met the Cost Share /
                                        Matching obligation
                                        for this project.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The Deductive Approach: Program Income is deducted from the amount awarded by the
                                        sponsor to
                                        determine the net allowable federal share of costs. In other words, the total
                                        funds available to the
                                        project remain the same as the amount awarded by the sponsor. The funds
                                        generated by the Program
                                        Income reduce the amount that can be requested from the sponsor.</p>
                                    <p>For example, the sponsor has awarded FAU an amount of $75,000. The award terms
                                        and conditions state that any
                                        Program Income earned and spent on the project will reduce the amount that FAU
                                        can request from the sponsor.
                                        During the project period, there is Program Income generated and spent in the
                                        amount of</p>
                                    <p>$3,000. The $3,000 in Program Income is accounted for in a separate Banner Fund.
                                        FAU must report the Program
                                        Income earned and spent on the project to the sponsor. FAU accounts for the
                                        funds from the sponsor in a
                                        separate Banner Fund. FAU can request reimbursement from the sponsor for an
                                        amount up to
                                        $72,000 ($75,000 less $3,000).</p>

                            </ol>

                            <p>If the award document is not clear as to which approach FAU is to apply in spending and
                                reporting Program
                                Income, the Research Accounting Coordinator will contact the sponsor for guidance and
                                communicate the
                                approach to the PI and Department Budget Coordinator.</p>

                            <p>Although Program Income is relatively rare at the University, some projects/programs do
                                involve Program
                                Income. It is critical that the PI notify the Division of Research when Program Income
                                is being generated
                                from a sponsored project/program. FAU is required to spend and report Program Income in
                                accordance with OMB
                                Circular A-110, Section 24.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
