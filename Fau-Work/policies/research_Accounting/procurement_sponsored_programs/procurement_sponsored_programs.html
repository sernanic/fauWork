                    provisions and conditions
                    of the procurement of such services.</p>
                <p>The terms and conditions of an agreement should be stated clearly and unambiguously
                    in order that any
                    person would have no difficulty in determining that the precise duties and
                    obligations undertaken by
                    the University are not in violation of any of the laws of the state relative to the

                    funds.</p>
                <p>Only university personnel specifically delegated the authority, in writing, by the

                    limits of their
                    delegation. The approval of any contract or agreement by an authorized signatory
                    does not absolve

                    requirements
                    especially adherence to the competitive thresholds. All contracts and agreements</p>

                    by an

                <p>University agreements represent clear milestones and deliverables which shall be
                    approved by the

                    any payment(s)
                    being made. Contracts and Grants must be notified by the Principal Investigator as
                    soon as any
                    issues of subcontractor noncompliance, delays, changes to the scope, etc. become

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
