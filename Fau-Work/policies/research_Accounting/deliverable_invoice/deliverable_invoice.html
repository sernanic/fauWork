                        <p>Florida Atlantic University is required to invoice Federal and Non-Federal sponsors for
                            deliverables, according to terms and conditions of the award.</p>

                        <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish uniform procedures for all sponsored projects with
                            deliverables, in order to ensure adherence in submitting timely deliverable invoices
                            according to the terms and conditions of the award.</p>

                        <p>Research Accounting is available to answer questions and provide assistance regarding the
                            requirements of the Deliverable Invoice Policy.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Policy</h2>
                        <p>It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University that deliverable-based invoices be submitted
                            in accordance with the terms and conditions required by the sponsor. Sponsors may require
                            the scheduled receipts of a deliverable, or the scheduled receipt and acceptance of a
                            deliverable, prior to the release of research funds.</p>
                        <p>When, within these terms and conditions of the award, the sponsor considers receipt and/or
                            acceptance of the deliverable to be a prerequisite, payment may be withheld until the
                            sponsor considers this condition satisfied.</p>
                        <p>In circumstances of a deliverable not being submitted within the terms and conditions of the
                            agreement, the sponsor can declare a breach of contract and refuse to pay the invoice.
                            Therefore, it is extremely important for the Principal Investigator to request an extension
                            of time to submit the deliverable to the sponsor or request the invoice be submitted for
                            payment independent from acceptance of the deliverable. The Principal Investigator must
                            notify Research Accounting when the deliverable cannot be submitted on time and/or when the
                            deliverable schedule has been modified.</p>
                        <p><u> Rare or Extreme Circumstances:</u></p>
                        <p>Under circumstances where the sponsor has not accepted a deliverable and will not authorize
                            the release of research funds to satisfy a deliverable-based invoice, the Principal
                            Investigator must notify Research Accounting. The Principal Investigator will meet with
                            Research Accounting, Sponsored programs, and the Deputy Counsel, if necessary, to resolve
                            any unmet contractual issue.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
