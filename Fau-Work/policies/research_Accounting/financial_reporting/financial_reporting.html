                        <h2>Accountability</h2>
                        <p>Research Accounting is responsible for preparing all financial reports for sponsored projects
                            based on the
                            financial reporting requirements of the Federal and Non-Federal agency or sponsor. The
                            financial reports are
                            reviewed and approved by the director of Research Accounting or his/her designee to ensure
                            accuracy.</p>
                        <p>Principal Investigators and their departmental designees are responsible for reviewing
                            charges on their
                            awards to identify errors and prevent them from being included in financial reports.</p>
                        <p>Both Principal Investigators and their departmental designees are responsible and accountable
                            for financial
                            disbursements made with grant funds. Errors must be brought to the attention of Research
                            Accounting
                            <u>immediately</u> to prevent them from being included in financial reports.</p>

                        <p>Research Accounting reviews monthly the tracking database report to determine which projects
                            have ended and
                            which financial reports are due for the period.</p>
                        <p>Research Accounting contacts principal investigators and their departmental designee to
                            inform them when a
                            financial report is due. The principal investigator and departmental designee are given a
                            date by which to
                            complete their review of the project expenditures and inform Research Accounting of
                            completion.</p>
                        <p>For Final Financial Reports, Research Accounting notifies the departmental designee 30 days
                            prior to project
                            end date to take action to close out the project.</p>

                                <p>Research Accounting reviews the Federal, Non-Federal agency or sponsor&rsquo;s
                                    agreement to identify
                                    the financial reporting forms or other reports required. The Organization Detail

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
