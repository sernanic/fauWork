                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>The following procedures establish the guidelines for issuing and controlling payments to
                            research study
                            subjects for their participation in sponsored research projects. It details and
                            differentiates the payment
                            alternatives available to Principal Investigators and the associated requirements of each
                            method. The
                            University is responsible for compliance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements
                            for information
                            reporting. Current IRS regulations require that cumulative annual payments greater than $600
                            to an
                            individual be reported and special reporting rules apply to employees or nonresident aliens
                            (NRAs). In
                            complying with this reporting requirement, the University has established a threshold for
                            the collection of
                            taxpayer identification information for non-University employees and non-NRAs. If a single
                            study subject
                            payment exceeds $50 or cumulative study subject payments to an individual during the
                            calendar year are
                            expected to exceed $200, taxpayer information should be obtained and forwarded to the
                            designated
                            representative in the Controller&rsquo;s office. If the study subject is a University
                            employee, regardless
                            of the amount of the payment, taxpayer information must be collected and payment information
                            must be

                                            designated for study subject payments. This will preclude association of the

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
