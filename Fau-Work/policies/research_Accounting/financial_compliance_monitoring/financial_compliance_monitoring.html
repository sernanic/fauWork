                        <p><u>Allocable:</u> A cost is allocable to a project if
                            goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable in accordance with the relative
                            benefits
                            received by the projects. In order to be allocable a cost must be treated consistently in
                            like
                            circumstances. For further information see OMB Circular A-21 (Relocated to 2 CFR, Part 220).

                            (1) the costs are reasonable; (2) the costs are allocable to the specific project; (3) the
                            costs are

                            institutional

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
