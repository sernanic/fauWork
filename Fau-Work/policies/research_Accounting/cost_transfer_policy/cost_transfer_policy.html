                            applicable to sponsored projects and to consistently and uniformly administer sponsored

                        <h2>Policy</h2>
                        <p>It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University that costs are charged to the appropriate
                            sponsored
                            project when first incurred for all federal or non-federal sponsored programs for all cost
                            categories,
                            including payroll costs. However, the University recognizes that there are circumstances in
                            which it may
                            be necessary to transfer expenditures to a sponsored project subsequent to the initial
                            recording of the
                            charge. When a cost</p>
                        <p>transfer (non-salary and salary costs) is identified as a necessary reallocation of costs,
                            the following
                            is required in order to process a transfer:</p>
                        <ol>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Only in the case of exceptional circumstances will cost transfers for any
                                            expenses
                                            (including payroll re-allocations) which occurred more than 90 days after
                                            the initial

                                    Circular A-
                                    110, along with any sponsored agreement specific requirements. <br /><br />
                                    <u>Allowability:</u> The cost must be allowable under the terms and
                                    conditions of the
                                    award, including the authorized budget and applicable regulations.<br /><br />

                                    <u>Allocability:</u> The cost of goods or services must benefit the award
                                    charged.
                                    Goods or services shared by more than one project are allocable in
                                    proportions
                                    that can be approximated through actual use. Example: If you are
                                    charging
                                    Project A for 50% of an item purchased, Project A must receive half
                                    the benefit
                                    or use of that item.<br /><br />
                                    <u>Reasonableness:</u> A cost may be considered reasonable if the nature of
                                    the goods
                                    or service acquired and the amount paid, reflect the action that a
                                    prudent
                                    person would have taken at the time the decision to incur the cost
                                    was made.<br /><br />
                                    <u>Consistency:</u> The application of costs must be given consistent
                                    treatment within
                                    established University policies and procedures including Generally

                                    <u>Timeliness</u> : All transfers should be made in 90 days. Exceptions
                                    require full
                                    documentation of reason for delay. Exceptions are not applicable for

                        <p>Completed and signed forms are to be submitted to the Office of Research Accounting,

                        <p>Research Accounting will review all cost transfers (non-salary and salary) based upon the
                            criteria of the
                            University&rsquo;s Cost Transfer Policy. If the cost transfer is adequately justifiable, has
                            sufficient
                            support documentation and was submitted on the appropriate form, then Research Accounting
                            will verify if
                            the cost transfer is allowable, allocable, reasonable, consistent, and timely under the
                            terms of a
                            sponsored agreement. If Research Accounting is unable to approve a cost transfer due to lack
                            of
                            justification, support documentation, allowability, etc. they will return it to the
                            requesting
                            department. Cost Transfers that are approved by Research Accounting will be forwarded to the
                            Controller&rsquo;s Office (Administration Building, Room 149) for further review and data
                            processing.

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
