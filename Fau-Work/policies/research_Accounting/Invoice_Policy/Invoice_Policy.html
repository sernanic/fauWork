                        <p>Florida Atlantic University is required to invoice Federal and Non-Federal sponsors in
                            accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish uniform invoicing procedures for all sponsored
                            research projects to ensure accountability, adherence to the terms and conditions of the
                            project as well as issue timely invoices.</p>

                        <h2>General Statement</h2>
                        <p>Research Accounting is available to answer questions and provide assistance regarding the
                            requirements of the Invoice Policy.</p>

                        <h2>Policy</h2>
                        <p>It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University that sponsored research projects will be
                            invoiced or drawdowns will be processed based on the instructions required by the sponsor.
                            In the absence of a stated invoice or drawdown requirement, the Research Accounting Office
                            will request reimbursement for the project on a monthly basis. Invoice frequency can vary
                            from monthly, quarterly, deliverable-based (milestone) or payment schedule.</p>

                        <h2>Procedures</h2>
                        <p>Research Accounting will review the award document to verify invoice or drawdown requirements
                            and establish a schedule within the financial accounting system based on the sponsor
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>Based upon the established schedule, the Research Accountant will perform the following in
                            order to review and submit an invoice or process a drawdown request:</p>
                        <ul>

                                <p>Review the Grant inception to Date Report (current period and cumulative report of

                                <p>Review that expenditures do not exceed the approved budget and current expenditures
                                    are allowable and allocable prior to requesting reimbursement</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Review the Organizational Detail Report, if needed, (detailed transaction ledger) for
                                    details regarding a specific expenditure transaction or to obtain details regarding
                                    the source document (invoice, receipt, travel report, etc.)</p>

                                <p>An invoice will be generated from the financial accounting system and submitted to
                                    the sponsor by email or U.S. Mail (invoices are typically generated for non- federal
                                    sponsors, federal-flow through subcontracts and some state agencies)</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>A drawdown request will be submitted and processed through the sponsor designated
                                    website (drawdowns are requested from federal sponsors and the Florida Department of
                                    Education)</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>The invoice or drawdown worksheet will be kept on file along with the Grant Inception

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Invoices should be submitted to the sponsor within 30 days at the end of the billing
                            period. Deliverable-based (milestone) invoices will be submitted to the sponsor when
                            the Research Accountant receives confirmation from the Principal Investigator that
                            deliverables have been submitted.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
