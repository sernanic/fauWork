                        <p>The federal government requires recipients of federal funding to establish an institutional
                            policy that
                            documents the budgeting and expensing of salaries on sponsored awards. These federal
                            requirements shall be
                            consistently applied to all sponsored awards at Florida Atlantic University.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish Florida Atlantic University&rsquo;s definition of
                            Institutional
                            Base Salary (IBS), the basis for calculating faculty salaries in proposals and to ensure
                            compliance with the
                            requirements of 2 CFR 200.430 Compensation (Uniform Guidance).</p>
                        <p>For purposes of this policy, &ldquo;awards&rdquo; will be used to refer to all agreements,
                            grants, contracts,
                            projects, Notice of Awards (NOA), Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), etc. that are funded by

                        <p>Policy</p>
                        <p>It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University that salary charges to sponsored programs are
                            based on the
                            institutional base salary and not to exceed salary caps or other limitations imposed by
                            external sponsors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Institutional Base Salary (IBS) is defined as the annual compensation paid by Florida
                            Atlantic University for
                            an employee&rsquo;s appointment, whether that individual&rsquo;s time is spent on
                            instruction, research,
                            patient care, or other institutional activities. IBS <u>includes</u> regular salary,
                            compensation for
                            instruction, research, patient care or other institutional activities. IBS does <strong>not
                            </strong>include: fringe benefit payments, reimbursed expenses, bonuses, supplemental
                            compensation, one-time
                            payments, incentive payments, salary paid directly by another organization and income that
                            an individual is
                            permitted to earn outside of their University responsibilities, such as consulting.
                            Institutional Base
                            Salary may not be increased as a result of replacing University salary funds with sponsor
                            projects funds.

                                <u>Salary Cap</u>
                                <p>Note that some sponsors may have a salary rate cap which would limit the amount of
                                    IBS that could be
                                    used as a basis for charging salary to their projects. When requesting salary
                                    support from a sponsor
                                    or providing effort on a sponsored project in the form of mandatory or voluntary
                                    committed cost
                                    sharing, the anticipated effort calculated in the form of person months or percent
                                    effort must be
                                    based on the individual&rsquo;s IBS. The portion of effort multiplied by the IBS
                                    will determine the
                                    appropriate dollars to request from the sponsor. If a sponsored project has a salary
                                    cap, then an
                                    individual&rsquo;s salary in excess of the salary rate cap is unreimbursable by the
                                    sponsor and
                                    therefore an unallowable cost, although a cost to the project. The unallowable
                                    portion of salary
                                    over the cap will be charged to a non- sponsored Salary Cap account.</p>

                                            cap amounts). For
                                            example, with a salary cap of $185,100 a faculty member who earns $250,000

                                            effort on an award may recover $18,510 from the federal sponsor ($185,100
                                            cap x 10% =
                                            $18,510). The institution must contribute $6,490 ($250,000 -
                                        $185,100 x 10% = $6,490) in a non-sponsored Salary Cap account.</p>

                                <u>Supplemental Compensation</u>
                                <p>Supplemental compensation is pay for work done in excess of the normal workload. It
                                    includes
                                    compensation for incidental work or summer salaries. Supplemental compensation must
                                    be reasonable
                                    and is usually temporary. It may be allocated as a single payment or spread over the
                                    course of the
                                    primary appointment. Charges for work performed on sponsored awards during the
                                    academic year, will
                                    be based on the individual&rsquo;s regular compensation for the continuous period
                                    which under the
                                    policy of FAU, constitutes the basis of his/her salary. Charges for work performed
                                    on sponsored
                                    awards during all or any portion of such period are allowable at the base salary
                                    rate. In no event
                                    will charges to sponsored awards, irrespective of the basis of computation, exceed
                                    the proportionate
                                    share of the base salary for that period. This principle applies to all employees
                                    who are working on
                                    sponsored awards at the university.</p>

                        <p><u>Institutional Base Salary (IBS):</u>  The annual compensation paid by an organization for
                            an employee&rsquo;s
                            appointment whether that individual&rsquo;s time is spent on instruction, research, patient
                            care, or other
                            institutional activities is specifically set for a 9-month, 10-month or 12- month period
                            depending on the
                            individual&rsquo;s appointment. IBS does not include bonuses, one-time payments (lump sum),
                            summer pay for
                            9-month and 10-month faculty, or incentive pay. Also excluded from IBS is any income that an
                            individual is
                            permitted to earn outside of duties at Florida Atlantic University.</p>
                        <p><u>Institutional Base Salary Period:</u> The period of time during which an employee is under
                            appointment to the
                            University and for which the employee receives a stipulated salary for the
                            University&rsquo;s fiscal year.
                            For the purpose of calculating 9-month (19.5 Bi-weeklies) faculty salary rates, the base
                            salary period is 9
                            months (19.5 Bi-weeklies). For professional staff and 12-month faculty (26.1 Bi-weeklies),
                            the base salary
                            period is the full 12 months (26.1 Bi-weeklies) of the fiscal year.</p>
                        <p><u>Supplemental Compensation:</u> Is any pay to faculty or staff for work done in excess of
                            the normal workload. It
                            includes compensation for incidental work or summer salaries. This type of compensation is
                            paid to faculty
                            with the classification of overload.</p>
                        <p><u>Incidental Work:</u> Activities that are in excess of an individual&rsquo;s normal
                            activities for which
                            supplemental compensation is paid by the University under institutional policy.</p>
                        <p><u>Full Workload: </u> The total activity for which the individual is compensated by the
                            University regardless of the
                            number of hours expended on those activities. Full workload includes: instruction, research,
                            patient care or
                            other institutional activities.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
