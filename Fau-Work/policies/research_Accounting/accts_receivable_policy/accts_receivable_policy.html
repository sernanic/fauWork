                        <p>Florida Atlantic University (FAU) is required to collect all accounts receivables from
                            Federal and
                            Non-Federal sponsors in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award. In the
                            absence of stated
                            award collection terms and conditions, the FAU Accounts Receivable Collection Policy will
                            prevail.</p>

                        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish uniform accounts receivable collection procedures
                            for sponsored
                            programs to ensure accountability and adherence to compliance requirements.</p>

                        <h3>General Statement</h3>
                        <p>Research Accounting is available to answer questions and address concerns regarding the
                            requirements of the
                            Accounts Receivable Collection Policy.</p>

                        <h3>Policy</h3>
                        <p>It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University that invoiced or billed amounts be collected
                            within thirty
                            (30) days of the invoice date. This collection date may also be grant specific, deliverable-
                            based, or
                            established as usual and customary business practice for recurring sponsors.</p>
                        <p>Research Accounting will review the award document to confirm the existence of special
                            circumstances, as
                            described above. When Research Accounting concludes that special circumstances, if any, have
                            been satisfied,
                            collection procedures shall commence.</p>
                        <p>In the event that the invoice address is different than the award document, a collection
                            notice shall be sent
                            addressed consistent with the award document; or, if silent, the last stated invoice address
                            shall be deemed
                            standard for collection notice purposes. Collection notices shall be submitted by U.S. Mail.

                            circumstances,

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
