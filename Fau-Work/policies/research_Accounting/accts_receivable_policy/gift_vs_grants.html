                        GIFT vs GRANT <br/></h2>
                    <p>This document, effective July 1, 2019, will assist in identifying the distinctions between a gift
                        and a grant/sponsored project. The terms “gifts” and “grants” are often used interchangeably,
                        but they have very distinct meanings for the University. <br />
                    </p>
                    <strong>Definitions: <br/></strong>
                    <p><strong>Gift.</strong>A voluntary, charitable contribution for which the donor does not expect or
                        receive any tangible benefits in return. It is essentially a donation. The donor may receive
                        recognition for the gift. Charitable contributions may be unrestricted or restricted, endowed or
                        non-endowed to a certain college, unit, or program, and are accepted through the University’s
                        direct support organization (FAU Foundation, Inc.). <br />
                        <strong>Restricted Gift:</strong>This category includes gifts made by a donor who instructs the
                        University as to the use of the funds in a specific academic area or for specific purposes. Gift
                        terms for restricted gifts may specify particular activities and budgets for those activities;
                        but usually do not specify how the funding must be spent or administered, and allow funding to
                        be utilized at the full discretion of the recipient, although respecting the overall gift
                        purposes. Financial reporting requested by donors of restricted gifts is normally in the
                        aggregate, although detailed reports are sometimes requested; in both cases this reporting is
                        solely intended to assure proper gift stewardship. Unexpended funds are not returned to the
                        donor at the expiration of the restricted gift period. <br />
                        <strong>Grant.</strong> A grant or sponsored project differs in that the sponsor/agency has
                        outlined specific
                        statement of work and there are expectations by the sponsor (i.e., foundation) in exchange for
                        the financial support provided. <br />
                        University: a contribution received by an institution for either unrestricted or restricted use
                        in the furtherance of the institution that typically comes from a corporation, foundation, or
                        other organization, rather than an individual. <br />
                        <strong>Research. </strong> A process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting information to
                        answer questions or
                        solve a problem. Basic Research is inquiry aimed at increasing scientific knowledge, and Applied
                        Research is effort aimed at using the basic research for solving problems or developing new
                        processes, products, or techniques. <br />
                        <strong>Sponsored Research.</strong> Research using any university space, facilities, materials,
                        equipment, or property. Sponsored Research supports research and development, but it
                        <strong>also includes instruction, training, professional development, curriculum development,
                            community and public service projects, and commercialization.</strong> <br />
                        The following <strong>Quick Reference Guide</strong> is to assist in distinguishing a gift from a sponsored
                        activity. The table highlights general characteristics of these two funding categories.
