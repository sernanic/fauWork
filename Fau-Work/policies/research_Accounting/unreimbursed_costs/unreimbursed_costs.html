                <h2><u>APPLICABILITY</u> </h2>
                <p>This policy is applicable to all members of the university community, including all students,
                    administrators, faculty, and staff.</p>
                <h2> <u>BACKGROUND</u> </h2>
                <p>Implementation of this policy will improve oversight and accountability for uncollectable costs by
                    ensuring that all costs incurred in connection with the conduct of a sponsored project are managed
                    by the responsible units. Timely movement of uncollectable costs will lead to more accurate and
                    complete financial information, and increased compliance with sponsor regulations regarding costs
                    and cash management.</p>
                <h2> <u>POLICY</u> </h2>
                <p>Costs charged to sponsored projects that will not be collected from the sponsor for reasons of
                    unallowability, unallocability, dispute with or bankruptcy of the sponsor, or for other reasons,
                    must be paid for with University funds. There is no available source of funds asset aside to cover
                    such over-expenditures, audit disallowances, or other costs that are not paid by the sponsor. These
                    costs must be covered by the department, college institute or center responsible for the project. It
                    is permissible to transfer an expense to the budgetary unit&rsquo;s current Educational and General
                    (E&amp;G) funds or returned overhead. The expense must be written against current year funds for
                    active projects.</p>
                <p>Sponsored agreements typically operate on a cost reimbursement basis with the Division of Research
                    being responsible for recovering the funds. There may be instances in which the</p>
                <p>sponsor is unwilling or unable to reimburse the University for the expenses incurred. When this
                    happens, the resulting cash deficit must be handled internally.</p>
                <p>When the sponsor does not pay the amount due for the following reasons, the department will be
                    responsible for covering the direct cost portion of the deficit, including, but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The sponsor went out of business.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The department/college performing the work failed to complete the project to the
                            sponsor&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The department/college began the work prior to receiving the award, and then the award was
                            not made.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Uncollectable costs will be moved to a non-sponsored departmental account promptly after the
                    determination is made by the Division of Research, or the responsible department that the costs will
                    not be reimbursed. If the uncollectable funds (or portion thereof) are subsequently collected from
                    the sponsor the collected amount will be applied proportionately to direct and F&amp;A costs.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the close out of contract/grant accounts that have been in deficit for more than 90
                    days after the account expiration, the Research Accounting Office will process expenditure transfers
                    to the Dean&rsquo;s overhead account for all such uncollectables. These costs will remain on the
                    Dean&rsquo;s overhead or other restricted account.</p>
                <p>If the Division of Research is culpable in creating the budget deficit by not properly invoicing the
                    sponsor, the Division must bear a share of the financial burden based on discussions with the Dean
                    of the College.</p>
                <h2> <u>DEFINITIONS</u> </h2>
                <strong>Research Accounting (RA):</strong>
                <p>The unit within the Division of Research that is responsible for financial aspects of post- award
                    administration. Responsibilities of this unit include, but are not limited to: Financial reporting,
                    invoicing, collecting on sponsored accounts, and coordination of external audits of sponsored
                    projects.</p>
                <strong>Unallocable Costs:</strong>
                <p>Costs that are allowable but are not assignable to a sponsored project because they do not provide
                    relative benefit to the project, or were otherwise not allocable under sponsor guidelines or the
                    specific sponsor agreement. Example - late charges (charges for goods or services that are allowable
                    but incurred after the project end date).</p>
                <strong>Unallowable Costs:</strong>
                <p>Costs that cannot be charged to a project per the sponsor&rsquo;s guidelines.</p>
                <p>Any other costs specified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21 that cannot be
                    included either in the development of the indirect cost rate charged, as a direct cost to a
                    federally sponsored project, or in the University recharge rates.</p>
                <strong>Uncollectable Accounts Receivable:</strong>
                <p>Any costs charged to a sponsored project that have been billed to the sponsor, but subsequent to the
                    billing are determined to be uncollectable from the sponsor.</p>
                <strong>Uncollectable Costs</strong>
                <p>Any costs charged to a sponsored project that will not be reimbursed by the sponsor. They include,
                    but not limited to:</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Budget overruns; <br/> Unallowable costs; <br/> Unallocable costs; and</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Other uncollectable costs that do not meet any of the above criteria, but that the sponsor is
                    otherwise unwilling or unable to pay, (e.g., amounts that are disputed by the sponsor, or amounts
                    deemed uncollectable due to sponsor bankruptcy).</p>
                <strong>Unit</strong>
                <p>Any organizational entity within the University that has budgetary authority. Includes, but is not
                    limited to colleges, departments, centers, institutes, etc.</p>
                <strong>Annual Review of Procedures Manual</strong>
                <p>The Policy on Unreimbursed Costs on Contracts and Grants will be reviewed annually.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
