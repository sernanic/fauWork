                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>Generally, compensation for personnel services is the largest expense charged to sponsored
                            awards. As a
                            condition to receive federal funding, institutions must maintain records that are supported
                            by a system of
                            internal control which provides reasonable assurance that the changes are accurate,
                            allowable and properly
                            allocated.</p>
                    </li>
                    <hr />
                    <li>
                        <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements for effort reporting on sponsored
                            awards to ensure
                            compliance with the applicable requirements of 2 CFR 200.430 Compensation (Uniform
                            Guidance). For purposes
                            of this policy, &ldquo;awards&rdquo; will be used to refer to all agreements, grants,
                            contracts, projects,
                            Notice of Awards (NOA), Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), etc. that are funded by an
                            external sponsor.</p>
                        <p>As a condition of receiving sponsored awards, Florida Atlantic University must assure
                            sponsors that the
                            effort expended on their awards justifies the salary charged to those awards and the
                            commitment indicated
                            (including mandatory and voluntary committed cost sharing) in the proposal and subsequent
                            awards are met in
                            accordance with the sponsor&rsquo;s terms and conditions. This assurance is demonstrated by
                            requiring
                            quarterly effort reports for employees whose salary is charged to sponsored awards and/or
                            cost sharing
                            account during the effort reporting period. These effort reports indicate the percentage of
                            the total effort
                            that is dedicated to sponsored award(s) and other University activities. In addition, the
                            effort report
                            requires a certification that the reported effort percentages are accurate. Effort is not
                            calculated on a
                            40-hour work week, but is expressed as a percentage based on the total hours spent on
                            work-related duties.
                        </p>
                        <p>Employees with any portion of their salary charged directly to a sponsored award or cost
                            share account are
                            subject to effort reporting. They must be aware of their level of committed effort to
                            sponsored awards and
                            the ability to meet those commitments along with any other University obligations they may
                            have.</p>

                        <p>It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University that certifications of effort are required
                            for university
                            employees whose salary or wages are directly charged to sponsored awards in order to ensure
                            that the
                            salaries and wages charged to these sponsored awards are allowable, allocable, reasonable,
                            and treated
                            consistently.</p>

                                <strong>Effort Reporting</strong>
                                <p>Effort reporting certifies to the external sponsor that the percentage of effort
                                    required as a
                                    condition of the award has actually been completed. FAU utilizes an after-the-fact
                                    reporting system
                                    which reflects the distribution of salaries and wages supported by an activity
                                    report that
                                    represents actual costs. Charges are initially made on the basis of an estimate of
                                    one&rsquo;s
                                    effort before the services are performed. This system reflects employees&rsquo;
                                    payroll distribution
                                    to various institutional accounts, including cost share, and sponsored award
                                    accounts. It documents
                                    the distribution of salaries and wages based on a reasonable estimate, which
                                    distinguishes between
                                    institutional and sponsored activities and reports this on a quarterly basis.</p>
                                <p>To ensure that the effort reporting system reasonably reflects actual effort expended
                                    during the
                                    reporting period, the person completing the effort certification must be someone who
                                    has direct
                                    involvement with the sponsored award and has suitable means of verification as well
                                    as firsthand
                                    knowledge that the work was performed.</p>
                                <p>In determining &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo;, 2 CFR 200.430 Compensation (Uniform
                                    Guidance) states,
                                    &ldquo;In an academic setting, teaching, research, service and administration are
                                    often inextricably
                                    intermingled. A precise assessment of factors that contribute to costs is not always
                                    feasible, nor
                                    is it expected.&rdquo; As a result, in determining the effort percentage, FAU allows
                                    for the use of
                                    reasonable estimates in which a, +/-5% (of the initial committed effort) degree of
                                    tolerance is
                                    allowed between the actual time spent and what is reported.</p>

                                        <p>For example, if your salary is allocated 30% to an award an adjustment would
                                            not be required
                                            if the expended effort can reasonably be determined to fall between 28.5%
                                            and 32.5%.</p>

                                <p>The certified effort report must reflect all activities for which the employee is

                                    Florida Atlantic University and the total work expended must equal 100%.</p>
                                <p>All departments must ensure that initial allocations of salaries to sponsored awards
                                    are
                                    reasonable in relation to the expected effort of the employees whose salaries are
                                    being
                                    allocated and that such allocations are monitored and adjusted where necessary to
                                    reflect
                                    significant changes in an employee&rsquo;s effort.</p>

                                        <p>All applicable employees at Florida Atlantic University will certify effort
                                            quarterly
                                            using a suitable means of verification. At a minimum, suitable means of
                                            verification
                                            should be accompanied by some form of written documentation. The
                                            documentation used
                                            as suitable means of verification needs to be sufficient to support a

                                            estimate of effort expended. Oral verification from a principal investigator

                                        <p>Following the end of each reporting period, the Research Accounting Office
                                            will use
                                            the Effort Reporting System to generate reports for Pre-Review and
                                            Certification in
                                            order to provide oversight of direct salaries charged to sponsored awards.
                                            The role
                                            of the Pre-Reviewer is a system-secured role that is identified by
                                            department
                                            (supervisory organization) and assigned by the Research Accounting Office.
                                            The role
                                            of Certifier is a system-secured role that is auto-assigned based on the

                                            name. The reports will provide the distribution of salary payments by

                                            may or may not coincide with the amount of effort actually performed. Upon

                                            the record, if salary allocations are not representative of actual effort

                                            the allocations shall be adjusted to be accurate. These effort reports must

                                        <p>The Effort Reporting System automatically routes effort certification reports
                                            directly to the employee in order to certify. In the event of extraordinary
                                            circumstances whereby an employee is unavailable to certify their effort or
                                            has left
                                            the University, the Research Accounting Office should be notified in order
                                            to
                                            determine the appropriate steps to assign alternate certification. The
                                            person
                                            completing the effort certification must have suitable means of
                                            verification;
                                            therefore an alternate certifier</p>
                                        <p>would most likely be the Principal Investigator (PI) for the award (<em>if

                                        <p>Non-compliance can result in disallowances and a financial loss to the
                                            University. In
                                            addition, disallowances as a result of audit findings could require the
                                            return of federally
                                            awarded funds. Failure to follow the provisions of FAU&rsquo;s effort
                                            reporting policies and
                                            procedures may subject the employee and departments responsible for the

                                <p>Proposals should clearly state the amount of effort and equivalent salary committed
                                    by the PI or key
                                    personnel who have a significant role in meeting the objectives of a sponsored
                                    award. Principal
                                    Investigators and key personnel should request full salary support for the effort
                                    that they expect
                                    to expend in meeting the objectives of the award. FAU requires a minimum commitment
                                    of 1% effort for
                                    the PI or key personnel, during the period in which the effort will be expended
                                    (academic year,
                                    summer term only or both). When the PI or key personnel&rsquo;s effort is committed
                                    in the proposal
                                    and the related salary is <u>not</u> directly charged to the sponsored award, then

                                    workload that includes activities such as instruction, research, patient care and

                                    institutional activities.</p>
                                <p>At the proposal stage, department administrators and faculty must review proposed

                                    member. Department administrators and faculty must also review the faculty

                                    certify 100% of their effort to sponsored research. Rare exceptions to this may

                                    period(s). The amount of salary support requested should normally be determined by

                                    requirements. Some sponsors require that level of effort be proposed in terms</p>
                                <p>of person months. Since effort is not based on a forty hour work week, the
                                    calculation should be
                                    based on percentage effort converted into person months. To convert percent effort
                                    to person-months,
                                    multiply the total effort percentage by the number of months and the Full Time

                                    tolerance +/-
                                    5%, an adjustment to the effort report is necessary. This is accomplished by
                                    completing a Payroll
                                    Accounting Adjustment. Labor/Salary redistributions or corrections cannot be
                                    processed on a Journal.
                                    Journals do not reflect payroll changes by employee name; therefore any payroll
                                    transactions
                                    processed by journal will not be reflected in the effort reports.</p>

                                    University policies and procedures for cost transfers. Once the effort has been
                                    certified, no

                                    other named key personnel on the proposal.</p>
                                <p>Some effort should be provided by PIs on research awards; there is no exception for
                                    awards that are
                                    in no cost time extension periods. However, there is also the realization by Federal
                                    agencies that a
                                    PI&rsquo;s effort may be reduced during no-cost extensions as the project is winding
                                    down, or
                                    additional time is needed for data analysis. Depending on the federal agency, the
                                    institution and
                                    the PI may need to request prior written approval</p>
                                <p>from the sponsor for a reduction in effort that is greater than 25% of the proposed
                                    effort to avoid
                                    discrepancies with current and pending support statements, effort certification, or
                                    issues of
                                    research overlap. To determine if prior written approval is required, review the

                        <p><u>Effort:</u> The portion of time spent on any activity, expressed as a percentage of the
                            total activity. Effort is
                            not calculated on a 40-hour work week, but is calculated as a percentage based on the total
                            hours spent on
                            work-related duties. For example, if a person averages 60 hours per week during a reporting
                            period and
                            spends an average of 15 hours on a Sponsored Project, that person has spent 25% effort on
                            the sponsored
                            project and 75% effort on other activities.</p>
                        <p><u>Effort Report(s):</u> The mechanism used to provide a sponsoring agency with a reasonable
                            assurance that salaries
                            paid from a grant are appropriate and reflect a reasonable estimation of the time spent
                            working on the
                            project.</p>
                        <p><u>Total Effort:</u> The total appointed time in the payroll system and all work-related
                            activities paid is the
                            total effort or 100% effort of the employee. The total number of hours worked does not
                            affect total effort.
                            For example, if a person worked on average 20 hours or 40 hours a week, either equates to
                            100% of their
                            total effort.</p>
                        <p><u>Committed Effort:</u> The amount of time proposed for the PI and key personnel in the
                            approved sponsored
                            agreement. For example, if an NIH grant application proposes that an employee will devote
                            30% of his or her
                            effort to the grant, with salary support for 10% of effort, 20% of the effort will be
                            voluntary committed
                            cost share, and 10% charged to the grant, for a total of 30%.</p>
                        <p><u>Voluntary Committed Cost Sharing:</u> Cost share proposed by the University when it is not
                            a specific requirement
                            of the sponsor. When an award is received which proposed voluntary committed cost sharing,
                            the cost sharing
                            becomes a binding commitment that the University must provide as part of the performance of
                            the sponsored
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p><u>Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing:</u> Is not required by the sponsor as a condition for
                            the award and is not
                            committed in the proposal budget. It is typically the PI&rsquo;s or other key
                            researcher&rsquo;s effort that
                            is over and above the effort committed and budgeted for in a sponsored agreement. Voluntary
                            uncommitted cost
                            sharing does not have to be documented.</p>
                        <p><u>Institutional Base Salary (IBS):</u> The compensation paid by an organization for an
                            employee&rsquo;s
                            appointment, whether that individual&rsquo;s time is spent on instruction, research, patient
                            care, or other
                            institutional activities, and is specifically set for a 9-month, 10- month or 12-month
                            period depending on
                            the individual&rsquo;s appointment. IBS does not include bonuses, one-time payments (lump
                            sum), summer pay
                            for 9-month faculty, or incentive pay. Also excluded from IBS is any income that an
                            individual is permitted
                            to earn outside of duties at Florida Atlantic University.</p>
                        <p><u>Student Fellowship Award:</u> An award to the university intended to provide financial
                            support for a student.
                            This is not provided as financial aid but given to students in the form of an award, to
                            assist them with the
                            costs associated with graduate school.</p>
                        <p><u>Firsthand Knowledge:</u> Direct evidence of work performed. One may have this knowledge of
                            work performance by
                            either performing the work or through supervising the individual performing the work.</p>
                        <p><u>Suitable Means of Verification:</u> The process through which one receives assurance that
                            work was performed so
                            as to provide a certification of effort on the quarterly effort reports. This process must
                            take into
                            consideration other university records and provide for the documented review of such records
                            in support of
                            work performed. Some examples of these records might include: calendars, teaching schedules,
                            or logbooks.
                            Other means of verification may also suffice, including e-mails attesting to effort devoted

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
