                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Florida Atlantic University is required to comply with Property Standards in accordance with OMB
                        Circular
                        A-110.</p>
                </li>
                <hr />
                <li>
                    <h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish uniform guidelines for the management and disposition
                        of equipment
                        purchased with Federal funds. Equipment shall be defined as an article of nonexpendable tangible
                        personal
                        property. Florida Atlantic University&rsquo;s policy defines capital equipment as equipment with
                        an
                        acquisition cost of $5,000 or more and a useful life of more than one year.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>General Statement</h2>
                    <p>Research Accounting and Property Management Department are available to answer questions and
                        provide
                        assistance regarding the requirements of this policy.</p>
                </li>
                <hr />
                <li>
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>The Property Management Department&rsquo;s main mission is to provide cost effective controls to
                        facilitate
                        the safeguarding of university acquired assets in accordance with Federal and State regulations
                        and
                        University guidelines. This includes effective and efficient management of property records. The
                        identification and recording of capital assets with a bar-coding system that provides permanent
                        identification affixed to the asset creates a property record that provides pertinent
                        information on all
                        aspects, both financial and historical for a specific capital item.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the Property Management Department performs a comprehensive, centralized, annual
                        inventory of
                        all university fixed assets both grant funded and non-grant funded with a threshold purchase
                        price value of
                        $5,000, or more. The Property Management Department is charged with the disposition of all
                        surplus equipment
                        and fixed assets within the confines of appropriate state statutes and university policy.</p>
                    <p>Purchases of equipment are allowable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the sponsored
                        agreement.
                        However, purchases of equipment requested within 90 days of the end of a research project
                        require a written
                        justification from the Principal Investigator and prior approval from the sponsor.</p>
                    <p> <u>Detailed Property Management Files for all Federally Acquired Equipment:</u>  All detailed Property
                        Management
                        Files for federally acquired equipment with a threshold purchase value of greater than $5,000
                        can be
                        provided upon request.</p>
                    <p><u>Equipment availability for use on other projects during initial use:</u>  The University shall use the
                        equipment
                        in the project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project continues
                        to be
                        supported by Federal funds, and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal
                        awarding
                        agency.</p>
                    <p>During the time that equipment is used on the project for which it was acquired, the University
                        will make it
                        available for use on other projects if such use does not interfere with the work on the project
                        for which it
                        was originally acquired.</p>

                        services
                        to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for
                        equivalent services unless authorized by Federal statute.</p>

                                without
                                filing of paperwork as long as the asset has a current fiscal year inventory date.</p>

                    <p><u>System to prevent loss, theft, and damage:</u>  The University incorporates a security system
                        throughout
                        all campuses for the safeguarding of all state and federally acquired equipment. Equipment is
                        bar-coded to insure asset identification; the serial number is recorded to identify equipment
                        reported stolen and subsequently recoverable through a nationwide database accessed by the
                        campus
                        police. Research labs are secured. The university has a Survey Board which periodically is
                        charged
                        with reviewing the requested write off of stolen and lost equipment.</p>
                    <p><u>Notification to Federal awarding agency for any loss, damage or theft:</u>  Principal Investigators
                        must
                        notify Federal awarding agency and Research Accounting for any loss, theft or damage of
                        equipment
                        purchased with Federal funds. The Division of Research is notified of items that are presented
                        and
                        approved by the Survey Board for deletion.</p>

                        university property for possible utilization by other federal projects.</p>
                    <p>When Federal equipment is no longer needed for the original project, the University shall use the

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
