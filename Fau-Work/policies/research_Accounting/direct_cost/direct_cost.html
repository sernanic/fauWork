                        <h2>Policy</h2>
                        <p>It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University that direct costs on all federal and non-
                            federal sponsored
                            programs for all cost categories, including payroll costs, be accurately charged to the
                            appropriate FAU
                            project account to maintain the financial</p>
                        <p>integrity for sponsor programs. In order to maintain the financial integrity direct costs
                            must adhere to the
                            following criteria:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>Direct costs must meet the allowability, allocability and reasonableness guidelines
                                    described in OMB
                                    Circular A-21 and consistently in OMB A-110, along with any sponsored agreement
                                    specific
                                    requirements;</p>
                                <ol type="A">
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Definitions</p>
                                        <p><u>Allowability:</u> The direct cost must be allowable under the terms and
                                            conditions of the
                                            award,
                                            including the authorized budget and applicable regulations.</p>
                                        <p><u>Allocability:</u> The direct cost of goods or services must benefit the
                                            award charged.
                                            Goods or
                                            services shared by more than one project are allocable in proportions that
                                            can be
                                            approximated through actual use.</p>
                                        <p><u>Example:</u> If you are charging Project A for 50% of an item purchased,
                                            Project A must
                                            receive
                                            half the benefit or use of that item.</p>
                                        <p><u>Reasonableness: </u> A direct cost may be considered reasonable if the
                                            nature of the goods
                                            or
                                            service acquired and the amount paid, reflect the action that a prudent
                                            person would have
                                            taken at the time the decision to incur the cost was made. Costs should be
                                            reasonable in
                                            price, as well as in quantity, in order to accomplish the project&rsquo;s
                                            objectives.</p>
                                        <p><u>Consistency:</u> The application of direct costs must be given consistent
                                            treatment within
                                            established University policies and procedures including Generally Accepted
                                            Accounting
                                            Principles and Cost Accounting Standards as issued by the Federal Cost

                                            Direct costs that benefit the project should be incurred throughout the life
                                            of the
                                            award. Direct costs submitted within the last 30 days of the project period
                                            may be
                                            considered to be &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; if direct costs are: (1) not

                                            federal government will not reimburse universities for certain costs that it
                                            considers unallowable. These unallowable costs are specifically identified
                                            in OMB Circular A-21, Section J. as <u>unallowable costs on Federal grants
                                                and contracts</u>. The following list below are examples of unallowable
                                            costs. This list is &ldquo;<u><strong>not inclusive</strong></u>.&rdquo;</p>

                                            programs may have additional cost limitations included in the terms and

                                            document must be adhered to in addition to the OMB Circulars. If a
                                            Federal sponsor does not allow a certain expense on a project or limits
                                            the amount of the cost, the unallowable cost cannot be charged to
                                            another Federal project. For example, National Institutes of Health

                                            Circular A-21, Section C, 5 states that &ldquo;applicable credits&rdquo;

                                            reduce direct or F&amp;A cost items. Examples of such transactions are:
                                            purchase discounts, rebates, or allowances; recoveries or indemnities on

                        <p><u>Allocable</u> A cost is allocable to a project if

                            circumstances. For further information see OMB Circular A-21 (Relocated to 2 CFR, Part 220).

                            level of such services provided by academic departments. Major projects are those that are

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
