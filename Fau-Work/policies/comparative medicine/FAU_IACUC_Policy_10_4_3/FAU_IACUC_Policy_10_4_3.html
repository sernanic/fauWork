                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>Public Health Policy (PHS), the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the
                            <em>Guide</em>) and the
                            Animal Welfare Regulations (AWR) agree that all animals used in research, teaching and
                            testing have to be
                            procured abiding to relevant federal, state and local laws and regulations. The <em>Guide
                            </em>states that
                            potential vendors should be evaluated for the quality of animals they supply. In general,
                            vendors of
                            purpose-bred animals provide information describing the genetic and pathogen status of their
                            animals and
                            relevant clinical history. Therefore, the use of purpose-bred and pre- conditioned animals
                            is preferable
                            when consistent with the research, teaching, and testing objectives where as animals
                            obtained from pet
                            stores/distributors bear the potential for introducing health risks to personnel and other
                            animals.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of whether the animals are quarantined, as per <em>Guide </em>newly received
                            animals should be
                            given a period for physiologic, behavioral, and nutritional acclimation before their use.
                            The length of time
                            for acclimation will depend on the type and duration of animal transportation, the species
                            involved, and the
                            intended use of the animals.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        <p>To establish a policy that will provide guidance to Research Personnel and Animal Care Staff
                            in regards to
                            procurement of animals for research and teaching as well as the animals&rsquo; acclimation
                            to changed
                            conditions such as new environment and feed to support highest standards for quality of
                            research, animal
                            health and welfare.</p>

                        <p>All animals acquired for use in research, teaching, and testing at FAU must be procured
                            through Comparative
                            Medicine and should be appropriately acclimated. This is not only essential for the
                            well-being of the animals but also for the scientific
                            outcome of the

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
