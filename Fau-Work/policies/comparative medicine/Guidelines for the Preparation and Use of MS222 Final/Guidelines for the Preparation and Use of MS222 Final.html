                    <h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
                    <li>
                        <p>It is the responsibility of the PI on the corresponding animal use protocol to assure the
                            safe use of MS222
                            by laboratory staff. The PI is responsible for the appropriate training of research
                            personnel for the safe
                            use of this anesthetic in the species approved on the protocol.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Personnel using MS222 should be familiar with the MSDS, which should be readily available in
                            the lab.
                            Questions regarding safety practices should be directed to FAU Environmental Health &amp;
                            Safety.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>MS222 is not regulated as a hazardous waste by the US Environmental Protection Agency under
                            the Resource
                            Conservation and Recovery Act. However, users should realize that it is considered an
                            irritant to the eyes,
                            respiratory system and skin and safety precautions need to be employed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>To prevent exposure, the powder should be weighed in a fume hood. If a fume hood is not
                            available then the
                            powder may be weighed in a well-ventilated area such as a lab or similar space. If the
                            powder is weighed
                            outside of a fume hood employees within six feet of the balance must wear N, R, or P 95
                            respirators. To
                            avoid skin and eye contact, goggles, gloves and a lab coat/protective clothing should be
                            worn while
                            measuring the powder. Using a top loading balance with a clear plastic wind/breeze guard can
                            help minimizing
                            the risk of having the light powder blowing around by air currents.</p>
                        <p>Note: Employees who are required to wear respirators must be in the respiratory protection
                            program.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In typical use, the mode of action is by absorption through the skin of aquatic animals. It
                            can also permeate
                            human skin although at a much lower rate, particularly when dissolved. Personnel should
                            therefore minimize
                            contact with medicated water whenever possible and should be aware and attentive to nausea
                            or headaches
                            after any prolonged exposure of even low concentrated MS222 solution.</p>

                    </li>
                    <h2>Preparation</h2>
                    <li>
                        <p>Diluents or vehicles must be specified in the animal use protocol.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>MS222 can be administered via immersing the animal in a MS222 solution (i.e. water bath),
                            spraying onto gills
                            with an aerosol pump sprayer in large fish (anesthesia only), or injected directly into the
                            lymph sacs
                            (amphibians) or the coelomic cavity (amphibians and reptiles).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>MS222 can acidify aqueous solutions and therefore solutions may need to be buffered with
                            Sodium Bicarbonate.
                            The investigator needs to consider this possibility and keep the pH of the final solution
                            near the ambient
                            environmental pH for the particular species. Failure to buffer the solution appropriately
                            could result in
                            discomfort/pain to the subjects. For poorly buffered water sources there should generally be
                            a ratio of 1:2
                            (weight:weight) of MS222 : Sodium Bicarbonate powder.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>MS222 is water soluble and should be prepared in water similar to the natural living
                            conditions of the animal
                            when used as a water bath. Preferably water should be taken from the animal&rsquo;s original
                            holding tank or
                            natural water source. The water should have adequate levels of dissolved oxygen, an
                            appropriate pH,
                            temperature, salinity and hardness.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use sterile water or saline and aseptic technique for preparation of MS222 for
                            <strong>injections</strong>.
                            To assure that the product is sterile it must be passed through a syringe filter (0.22 um or
                            finer) at the
                            time of preparation. This can be done in the process of transfer to an injection vial. MS222
                            for injection
                            has to be prepared fresh each time.</p>
                        <p>Note that sterile injection vials are available through Comparative Medicine.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>MS222 comes in a powdered form and should be stored at room temperature, in a cool dry place
                            protected from
                            light.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use of freshly prepared solutions is recommended, especially if used for surgical procedures
                            to minimize
                            contamination and infection. It has been reported that after 10 days, a 10 percent solution
                            showed a 5%
                            decrease in potency.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A stock solution can be prepared for use in water bath or spray applications. Commonly used
                            MS222 stock
                            solutions are at 10g/L using aged tap water. Sodium Bicarbonate should be added (10-20g/L).

                        <p>The action of MS222 as an anesthetic varies widely between species and is affected by water
                            temperature,
                            hardness, and size of the individual animal. Preliminary tests are recommended to determine
                            concentration
                            and exposure time for each application to assure sufficient anesthetic depth and safe

                            following cessation of opercular movement. A concentration of at least 250mg/L is
                            recommended and might be
                            much higher in certain species.</p>

                        <p>For euthanasia, reptiles can be injected with MS222 into the coelomic cavity. Usually high

                            &gt;500mg/kg have to be administered that might, however, only lead to anesthesia instead of
                            euthanasia. If
                            MS222 is concentrated above 1% it cannot be buffered with Sodium Bicarbonate anymore since
                            it triggers a
                            strong chemical reaction rendering MS222 ineffective. Therefore, one paper (CJ Conroy et

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
