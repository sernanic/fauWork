                                            Turtles undergo ecdysis, i.e. regular shedding of skin, as any other
                                            reptile. The turtle&rsquo;s shell can look cloudy before shedding scutes or
                                            layers of shell. Turtles usually don&rsquo;t shed in one piece like snakes
                                            but rather in bits and pieces. This is a normal process and must be
                                            distinguished from abnormal health conditions concerning the skin/shell of
                                            turtles.

                                            in a reasonable time, the veterinarian will make the final decision
                                            regarding euthanasia to avoid suffering of the animal.

                                            The research personnel will determine whether a sick animal should be
                                            examined by the veterinarian or euthanized.

                                            If the research personnel want to keep the animal, the veterinarian will

                                            warranted. The veterinarian based on her/his expertise will determine any
                                            further action necessary.

                                            If the veterinarian is not available on time, the care staff will

                                            If the veterinarian decides that the animal needs to be euthanized, the
                                            research personnel will be informed. The expectation is that the animal will
                                            be euthanized within 24 hours of notification to allow the research staff to

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
