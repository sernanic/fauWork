                                            Maintain and sample a minimum of two sentinel mice or rats per sentinel
                                            cage. More sentinels can be housed in the same cage to serve as backups.

                                            At every bedding change, contaminate the sentinel cage with 2-5ml dirty
                                            bedding from every monitored cage or more if a small number of cages is
                                            monitored.

                                            Colony representative animals can be used to characterize the microbial
                                            status of rodent production colonies at the discretion of the veterinarian.
                                            Animal(s) will be selected with the help of the PI to assure testing
                                            immunologically mature animals that are representative of the health history
                                            of their particular colony. Either non- lethal sample techniques will be
                                            employed or animals chosen that are not essential for a research study or
                                            breeding.

                                            Any unexpected health concern of a sentinel animal has to be recorded
                                            including details regarding signs observed, diagnosis, treatment and outcome
                                            of case if applicable. Whenever a sentinel is found dead a necropsy has to
                                            be performed. If either mice or rats in a sentinel cage die and a cause for
                                            death cannot be established a follow up investigation, e.g. testing of a
                                            corresponding colony representative, has to be initiated by the veterinary
                                            staff. The Attending Veterinarian has to be informed about any health
                                            concerns or deaths.

                                            The Attending Veterinarian is responsible for the testing of all sentinels
                                            or colony animals assisted by animal care staff trained for the procedures.
                                            The findings concerning each sentinel evaluation are recorded and reported
                                            to the Attending Veterinarian for interpretation and/or resolution as
                                            needed.

            <h2>The University...at a Glance</h2>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
