                                Health monitoring is an important part of an animal care and use program. All animals will be monitored by Comparative Medicine at least once daily from the day of arrival or being born until final disposition.

                                If animals are procured from approved vendors animals are allowed to enter the colony without further action. Shipping health reports will be filed and web health reports will be screened as described in Quarantine SOP (FAUSOP 204).

                                Animals from an unapproved vendor will be quarantined as per FAUSOP 204 Quarantine to establish their health status. Quarantined animals will be observed at least once daily also.

                                Arrival of animals requires that the shipping crate be sprayed with an approved disinfectant prior to entry into the vivarium. Each animal is examined for any abnormal signs while transferring from the shipping crate to the permanent cage. Any abnormalities found at this time need to be reported to the relevant research staff and the Vet Staff.

                                Any health concerns will be communicated with the research staff. Even if a senior person in the research lab is authorized to make decisions regarding animals the Principle Investigator will be copied on all emails sent to the research lab, so that she/he is aware of the particular situation.

Rodent health checks should be completed as early as possible in the workday, but workflow has to correspond with the differing health status levels. See FAUSOP 213 Workflow In and Between Vivaria.

<h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
