                                    will be prepared for the incoming shipment. The tanks will be filled, treated, and
                                    run for 24-48
                                    hours prior to turtles&rsquo; arrival. If both large tanks are occupied, the small
                                    holding tubs will
                                    be prepared for occupation. Prepare 1 holding tub per 4 small turtles, and 1 holding
                                    tub per two
                                    large turtles. <strong>Note: </strong>Incoming animals will not be mixed with
                                    current occupants.
                                    <strong>Note</strong>: Terrapins may require salt added to their water.</p>

                                    be sprayed down with disinfectant. The box will remain on the cart for the proper

                                <p>Lab personnel will be notified of the animals&rsquo; arrival. Lab personnel will need
                                    to check the
                                    animals for appropriate size (preferable within two hours) and give CM the all-clear
                                    to unpack the
                                    turtles. If the lab personnel don&rsquo;t inspect the turtles within two hours, they
                                    will be
                                    unpacked. <strong>Note</strong>: if the lab finds the parameters incorrect, the CAS
                                    needs to be
                                    notified immediately so the turtles can be returned to the vendor.</p>

                                <p>Once the lab has decided to keep the animals, CM will rinse the turtles in the sink
                                    and dry them off
                                    with a paper towel or Wypall. Each turtle will be weighed and labelled with the
                                    appropriate markings
                                    in toluene-free nail polish according to the identification chart provided in the
                                    room. Each new

            <h2>The University...at a Glance</h2>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
