        <u>Background</u>
        <p>State and federal human subjects regulations require that consent for research be obtained from the
            participant&rsquo;s legally authorized representative (LAR) if the subject lacks the capacity to consent (45
            CFR 46.116; 21 CFR 50.20.)</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Purpose</u>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for identifying who can act as a legally authorized
            representative when enrolling an individual with a cognitive impairment as a research participant in a study
            reviewed by the FAU Institutional Review Board (IRB). This policy also documents the responsibilities of the
            Principal Investigator (PI) and the IRB in ensuring that persons who lack the ability to consent due to
            cognitive impairment are consented properly prior to enrolling in a human subjects protocol and throughout
            their participation in that protocol.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <p>The Board recognizes the importance and value of including persons with cognitive impairment and/or
            mental/psychiatric illness in research, particularly when such research may help society better understand
            their condition, treat it, and improve their quality of life.</p>
        <p>However, the benefits of such research do not outweigh the fact that potential subjects may have a cognitive
            impairment that affects their ability to understand the responsibilities and implications of the research to
            which they are consenting. Therefore, individuals recruited and enrolled in a research protocol reviewed by
            the FAU IRB must a) participate in a consenting process that is both ethical and respects the legal rights
            of the subject and their family, and b) if warranted, be represented by an individual who has the legal
            authority to act on behalf of that person and who meets the definition of legally authorized representative
            as set forth in DHHS and FDA regulations [45 CFR 46.102(c); 21 CFR 50.3(l)].</p>
        <p>The IRB expects informed consent to be a process, where the PI will seek informed consent through a dialogue
            with the potential subject in addition to obtaining proper documentation of the subject and LAR&rsquo;s
            signatures on the informed consent form. Researchers may use assessment tools (such as the Mini-Mental State
            Examination (MMSE)] and similar instruments to quickly assess cognitive capability/competence to determine
            whether the subject has the cognitive capacity to provide consent. In using these instruments, it is
            important that researchers adopt the guidance about acceptable cut-off scores from recognized and
            scientifically specialized bodies (e.g., American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological
            Association, etc.) and/or current scientific literature for subject enrollment. In these cases, the
            researcher acts in the best interest of the human participant and for the prudent benefit of the study.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <p>If a PI plans to recruit and enroll individuals who may have a cognitive impairment that affects their
            ability to consent, they should assess the subject&rsquo;s capability of consenting to determine if an LAR
            is needed. Assessment is usually based on an objective scale or instrument (such as the MMSE) in conjunction
            with observation by a qualified, licensed health professional (e.g., physician, nurse, psychologist, LCSW,
            etc.)</p>
        <p>If the PI elects to use the MMSE to assess the subject&rsquo;s capacity to provide consent, and the subject
            scores <u>&lt;</u>23 (less than or equal to 23) on this scale, the subject is presumed to be incapable of
            consenting for him-/herself unless there is other documentation demonstrating competency and the signature
            of a Legally Authorized Representative is required. The conclusion of incompetency must be documented with
            the subject&rsquo;s records and is applicable only to the particular study. Subject assent must be obtained
            and recorded per Section VII of this document. For those persons scoring &gt;23 (24 and above), the subject
            is presumed to be competent to consent for him-/herself unless there are indications otherwise.</p>
        <p>The PI may elect to use other assessment tools or instruments to determine the subject&rsquo;s competency. In
            using any instruments, it is important that researchers adopt the guidance about acceptable cut-off scores
            from recognized and scientifically specialized bodies (e.g., American Psychiatric Association, American
            Psychological Association, etc.) and/or current scientific literature for subject enrollment. This guidance
            must be explained and justified as part of the protocol procedures.</p>
        <p>The PI must continue to assess the subject&rsquo;s competence (as outlined in Procedures below) to ensure
            there has been no regression in their cognitive status and that the participant continues to understand the
            responsibilities, risks, and benefits of study participation.</p>

        <u>Definitions</u>
        <strong>Legally authorized representative:</strong>
        <p>Federal (DHHS and FDA) regulations define a legally authorized representative as an individual, judicial or
            other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's
            participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research [45 CFR 46.102(c); 21 CFR 50.3(l)]</p>
        <p>In the State of Florida (765.401, Fla. Stat.), individuals who serve as proxy or surrogate are recognized as
            the subject&rsquo;s legally authorized representative and have the ability to consent to participation in
            human research, in the following order:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Health Care Surrogate<strong>. </strong>Individual named by a person while that person is still

            <li>
                <p>Guardian. Individual appointed by the court and specifically authorized by the court to enroll the
                    individual in the human research study. (In the State of Florida, a guardian must have court
                    appointed authority for a specific research activity before he/she can give consent for a
                    child&rsquo;s participation in research.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the absence of an Advance Directive, an Authorized Individual. Individual who is authorized under
                    applicable state or local law to consent on behalf of the subject to general medical care including
                    when that care involves research. [45 CFR 46.402(e); 21 CFR 50.3(s)].</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The person's spouse.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

                <p>The adult sibling of the person, or if the person has more than one sibling, a majority of the adult
                    siblings who are reasonably available for consultation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>An adult relative of the person who has exhibited special care and concern for the person and who has
                    maintained regular contact with the person and who is familiar with the person&rsquo;s activities,
                    health and religious and moral beliefs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A close [adult] friend of the person who has also shown special care and concern for the person.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A clinical social worker licensed pursuant to Chapter 491 of Florida Statutes, or who is a graduate
                    of a court-approved guardianship program. Such a proxy must be selected by the IRB and must not be
                    employed by, or under the supervision of, the PI</p>
                <p>For research conducted in other States or territories, the legal definition of legally authorized
                    representative will be determined by reference to the law of that state or territory.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The subject, and/or</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The subject&rsquo;s legally authorized representative (LAR). (If an LAR is required, he/she
                            should sign as an indication of &ldquo;consent&rdquo; and, if possible, the subject should
                            sign indicating &ldquo;assent&rdquo;). If the subject cannot sign, the investigator will
                            document waiver of written assent in writing.</p>
                    </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The PI must maintain an original signed consent document in the research files. IN ADDITION, the PI
                    is also required to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Provide one copy given to the subject and, if applicable, his/her LAR.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Provide one copy for the subject&rsquo;s official medical record, <em>if applicable</em>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For <strong>initial </strong>informed consent, the PI must place a detailed note in the file that
                    documents how the subject understood what was explained verbally and/or in the consent document. A
                    statement that &ldquo;the subject understood the information presented&rdquo; is not adequate as it
                    does not explain how this was determined. In general, the more detailed the note, the better.
                    Examples on how this is determined may include but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A written assessment of subject&rsquo;s recollection of key study points.</p>

                            of consent. (required)</p>

                <p>For <strong>ongoing </strong>consent, at each visit (if applicable), the PI must place a detailed
                    note in the file that details the subject&rsquo;s willingness to continue in the study as well as
                    the subject&rsquo;s understanding of the study. This note should include sufficient information to
                    determine that the subject is capable of making and has provided informed consent. Similar to above,
                    a note simply stating &ldquo;subject wishes to continue in study&rdquo; is not sufficient. This
                    statement does not adequately demonstrate how it was determined that the participant remains in a
                    state of continued informed consent. Examples on how this might be determined may include but is not
                    limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A written assessment of subject&rsquo;s recollection of key study points.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Verbal recollection of most key study points.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Verbal acknowledgement of understanding any amendments to the protocol or a newly developed
                            risk(s).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Documentation of subject&rsquo;s mental status as it pertains to decision-making at the time
                            of consent. (required)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>After ongoing assessment, if the subject is deemed incapable of continuing to provide informed consent, the
            subject&rsquo;s LAR should be sought for re-consenting. Until the LAR&rsquo;s consent can be obtained, the
            subject should not be involved further in study procedures. If an LAR cannot be obtained, the subject should
            be withdrawn from the study. The PI is advised to consult with the Research Integrity office under these
            circumstances.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
