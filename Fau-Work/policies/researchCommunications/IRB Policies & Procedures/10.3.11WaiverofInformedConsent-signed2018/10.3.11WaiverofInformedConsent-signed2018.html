                        <u>Background</u>
                        <p>Informed consent is one of the fundamental principles of ethical conduct in human subjects
                            research. It is mandated
                            by Federal regulations 45 CFR 46.116 and 46.117, as well as 21 CFR Subpart B. However,
                            federal regulations allow for
                            the waiver of documented informed consent, or complete waiver of informed consent in human
                            subjects research under
                            specific circumstances. [45 CFR 46.116 (c )(d), 45 CFR 46.117, 21 CFR 50.23 and
                            50.24].<br /><br />
                            “Documented informed consent” refers to the traditional informed consent form that is
                            signed by the research participant. Complete “waiver of informed consent” refers to non-use
                            of either a verbal or
                            written informed consent process.</p>
                    </li>
                    <hr/>
                    <li>
                        <u>Purpose</u>
                        <p>To provide guidance to investigators and other authorized research personnel on when a) a
                            waiver of documented
                            informed consent or b) a complete waiver of informed consent is permissible in human
                            subjects research, and to
                            outline procedures for requesting IRB approval of such a waiver.</p>
                    </li>
                    <hr/>
                    <li>
                        <u>General Statement</u>
                        <p>Informed consent is a process. Therefore, documentation of the consent process via a signed
                            consent form is not
                            always required. Instead, verbal consent might be more appropriate for certain populations
                            (including non-literate
                            or politically vulnerable populations) or certain types of anonymous, low-risk research.
                            Verbal consent means that
                            the potential research subject is read a verbal version (script) of the consent
                            form.<br /><br />
                            Alternatively, a consent paragraph that precedes an anonymous survey, or a consent letter
                            are sometimes acceptable, both
                            of which do not require a participant’s signature.<br /><br />
                            Occasionally, there are reasons to waive both written and verbal consent under certain
                            circumstances based on the nature
                            of the research. While the researcher may propose alternative informed consent mechanisms,
                            only the IRB can make the
                            final determination to waive some or all informed consent requirements

                            the IRB finds and documents that all four of the following are met:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;</li>

                            <li>The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration;

                            <strong>The FAU IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed

                            <li>The principal risks are those associated with a breach of confidentiality regarding the
                                subject’s participation in
                                the research, and the consent document is the only record linking the subject to the
                                research; and</li>
                            <li>Study participation presents minimal risk of harm to the subject, and the activity
                                normally does not require consent
                                except for the fact that this is a research study.</li>
                            <li>In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the
                                investigator to provide subjects
                                with a written statement regarding the research.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The FAU IRB shall follow its Children in Research policy when applying waiver of informed consent provisions
                                specific to children in research</strong>Provisions for waiver of assent or parental permission are specifically
                            outlined in this policy, and are consistent with the policy outlined here.</p>
                        <p><strong>Researchers may also request a waiver of consent in emergency care research.</strong>This typically occurs in
                            health care settings and applies to human subjects who are in a life threatening condition where an investigational
                            therapy may be beneficial, but there is not enough time to obtain legal informed consent. The federal regulations
                            (21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24) describe the situations where this can occur. This provision has limited applicability at
                            Florida Atlantic University.</p>

                        <strong>To request a waiver of documented informed consent (in other words, to not use a consent form that requires a signature), the PI should:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Include a request for waiver of documented informed consent as part of the
                                    IRB protocol. It is important that the PI discuss and justify the rationale for this requirement to be waived by the IRB. The request must address how the proposed research meets the following criteria: a) The principal risks are those associated with a breach of confidentiality regarding the subject’s participation in the research, and the consent document is the only record linking the subject to the research; and b) Study participation presents minimal risk of harm to the subject, and the activity normally does not require consent except for the fact that this is a research study.
                                    </li>
                            <li>As part of the IRB application, submit a proposed script of the verbal consent process, or alternative consent document (e.g., cover letter, consent paragraph, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong><i>Recommendations:
                            </i></strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When verbally consenting subjects, it is recommended that you hand out a separate business card or information sheet
                                to subjects with relevant contact information. In addition, it is recommended that investigators keep a log of those
                                who were approached about the study and offered verbal consent. A simple chart, numbered sequentially without
                                identifiers, is sufficient. It is important to keep some record to indicate that you are not enrolling more subjects
                                than the number approved in the IRB application.
                                </li>
                            <strong>To request a waiver of both written and verbal informed consent, the PI should:</strong>
                            <li>Include a request for waiver of both written and verbal informed consent as part of the IRB protocol. It is
                                important that the PI discuss and justify the rationale for this requirement to be waived by the IRB. The request
                                must address how the proposed research meets the following criteria:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>The proposed research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects.</li>
                                    <li>The waiver or alteration of consent will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.</li>
                                    <li>The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration. (It is not sufficient to say you don’t have enough money, time, or resources to carry out this function) and</li>
                                    <li>Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information (e.g., a debriefing) after participation. If a debriefing statement is to be used, it should be included in the IRB submission.</li>
                                </ol>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
