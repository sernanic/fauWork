        <u>Background</u>
        
        <p>Continuing Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval is required as long as study activity is
            ongoing, including intervention or interaction with subjects, continued use of a drug or device, and/or data
            analysis of identifiable data. When all study activity has ceased an investigator should close a research
            study. Regulations (21 CFR 56.108) require prompt reporting to the IRB of changes in a research activity;
            because the completion of a study is considered a change in activity, it must be reported to the IRB for
            processing.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Purpose</p>
        <p>This policy describes when and how a study may be closed or terminated by the Principal Investigator (PI) or
            the IRB.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <p>A process for closing studies shall be required because of the potential risks to human subjects that may
            arise if study activities are terminated without final review.</p>
        <p>Such risks may include ethically or medically indicated follow-up procedures that may otherwise not be made
            available.</p>
        <p>The IRB will notify a PI that IRB approval or active IRB status has expired or that the IRB has inactivated
            IRB approval due to non-response from the PI to IRB requests. The IRB and/ or the Institutional Official may
            also suspend or terminate IRB approval. Study closure requires IRB review and acceptance. Regardless of the
            category for study closure, the expiration date for IRB approval falls on the last day before the approval
            period end date.</p>
        <p>Study closure falls into the following four categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Closure request initiated by the PI;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Non-response from PI to IRB requests for revisions;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Closure due to non-enrollment of subjects;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lapse of approval due to PI&rsquo;s non-response to requests for continuing review.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If a study has been open for a period of three or more years and the PI has <u>not enrolled
                        subjects</u> in the study, the IRB may require study closure unless there are extenuating
                    circumstances for keeping the project open (e.g., the study is about a rarely seen condition).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A study should be terminated by the PI when <u>no further contact with human subjects</u> or their
                    individually identifiable information is planned, no subjects are or will be treated or followed,
                    and all identifiable data are gathered and analyzed. Investigators are expected to continue to honor
                    confidentiality protections for data after studies are officially closed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Studies may be closed when individually-identifiable <u>data are no longer being collected or
                        analyzed</u> on subjects. Multi-site studies, such as clinical investigations, may be closed
                    when the sponsor has completed all data queries on the FAU site&rsquo;s study records, has
                    &ldquo;locked&rdquo; the site data, and remaining data analysis will not be completed by FAU.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Studies may be <u>closed by PI</u> if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>

            <li>
                <p>Studies may be <u>closed by the IRB</u> without PI approval in the following circumstances:</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>If it is determined that the investigator is no longer affiliated with FAU;</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>In response to unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious or
                            continuing non-compliance, findings presented during an IRB review, or problems identified
                            in a monitoring process;</p>

                            clarifications within the timeframe determined by the IRB, based upon the vulnerability of
                            the subject population and the risk of the research;</p>

                <p>Closing an expired study is not considered termination of approval of research per 45 CFR 46.113 and

        <u>Definitions</u>
        <p><strong>Closed to Enrollment: </strong>Enrollment of new subjects is stopped either permanently or temporarily.</p>
        <p><strong>Temporary Closure to Enrollment:</strong> A study may be temporarily closed or closed to enrollment when there is a
            pause in the conduct of research or recruitment. (e.g. when conducting an interim analysis.)</p>
        <p><strong>Permanent Closure to Enrollment:</strong> A study is closed permanently when no further enrollment will occur and
            individually-identifiable follow-up data are no longer being collected on subjects.</p>
        <p><strong>Suspension: </strong>An action taken by the IRB or other body with such authority. It is a temporary or permanent
            halt to some or all research procedures short of a termination until the IRB (or other body with such
            authority) determines whether the research may re-commence (with or without modifications to the research)
            or whether the research must be terminated.</p>
        <p><strong>Termination:</strong> An action to permanently end a study with the guarantee that no further contact with human
            subjects or their individually identifiable information is planned; no subjects are or will be treated or
            followed; all data are gathered and analyzed; and any final reports or publications, if applicable, are
            complete. A PI may request to terminate a study when it no longer constitutes human subject research, which
            can be done by de-identifying the data. The IRB may also terminate a study, therefore halting further
            research.</p>

                    received initial/continuation review within the last six months and the PI has enrolled no subjects
                    in the last six months. PIs do not have to wait for the end of the study approval period to request

                    <li>
                        <p>Submit the continuing review / final report form with request to close the study,

                        <p>Submit an &ldquo;IRB Amendment form&rdquo; to transfer the study to another FAU PI. (Note:

                <p>If an investigator wants to use identifiable data from a closed research study, whether by the

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
