        <u>Background</u>
        <p>Florida Atlantic University faculty and students conduct a diverse array of human subject research projects,
            including clinical investigations that involve FDA approved as well as previously approved devices. Device
            studies involving human subjects must be in compliance with relevant Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
            Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) laws and regulations. Investigators planning, designing and
            implementing clinical studies need to be aware of these FDA and DHHS regulations, as well as FAU
            requirements.</p>
        <p>A device may require an investigational device exemption (<strong>IDE</strong>), a Humanitarian Use Device
            Exemption (<strong>HDE</strong>), an Abbreviated IDE, or may be exempt from the IDE under 21 CFR 812.2 (c).
            Specific requirements will depend on the device, its intended use and whether or not its use meets the
            definition of a significant risk (<strong>SR</strong>) or non-significant risk (<strong>NSR</strong>)
            device. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The simplest determination involves a device that meets criteria for <em>exemption </em>from IDE
                    requirements. This requires no FDA submission, but in most cases requires IRB approval.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If a device is determined to be a non-significant risk device, then the sponsor follows the
                    Abbreviated IDE requirements outlined under 21 CFR &sect;812.2 (b). This basically consists of IRB
                    approval, labeling, monitoring, and reporting, but submission of IDE paperwork to FDA is not
                    required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If a device is determined to be a significant risk device, then a full IDE submission to FDA is
                    required along with IRB approval institutional requirements.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Purpose</u>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to ensure that studies conducted by FAU investigators are in compliance with
            FDA and DHHS regulations and good clinical practices (GCP), and to ensure the protection and welfare of
            human research participants involved in clinical investigations of devices. In addition, this policy is
            intended to inform FAU investigators who are planning to conduct human research studies aimed at evaluating
            the safety or effectiveness of a device--in subjects, controls or their specimens--about applicable FDA and
            DHHS regulations.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <p>Prior to the use of a device in a clinical investigation, the investigator (or sponsor) must assess whether
            or not an Investigational Device submission is required from the FDA or provide justification and
            documentation that use of the device is exempt from the IDE requirements.</p>
        <p>This policy applies to ongoing and planned research involving marketed and investigational devices. This
            includes: 1) a protocol which will evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of a device in subjects, controls, or
            their specimens; or 2) a device intended for humanitarian use.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <p>All clinical research protocols conducted by FAU faculty and students that involve the use of medical devices
            must be fully compliant with all FDA and DHHS regulations. The IRB of record will review all clinical
            research protocols involving devices for evidence of compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>

        <u>Definitions (21 CFR 812.3)</u>
        <p>Device: An instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other
            similar or related article, including any component, part or accessory, which is intended for use in the
            diagnosis, cure, treatment or prevention of disease. A device does not achieve its intended purpose through
            chemical action in the body and is not dependent upon being metabolized to achieve its purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>&ldquo;Custom&rdquo; device<em>: </em></strong>a device that meets the following criteria--</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Deviates from devices generally available or from an applicable performance standard or pre-market
                    approval requirement to comply with the order of an individual physician or dentist;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Is not generally available to, or generally used by, other physicians or dentists;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Is not generally available in finished form for purchase or for dispensing upon prescription;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Is not offered for commercial distribution through labeling or advertising; and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Is intended for use by an individual patient named in the order of a physician or dentist, and is to
                    be made in a specific form for that patient, or is intended to meet the special needs of the
                    physician or dentist in the course of professional practice.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>510(K) Device:</strong> Devices that are substantially equivalent to other devices that are legally on the market are
            called 510(K) devices and can be marketed without clinical testing.</p>
        <p><strong>Humanitarian Use Device:</strong> A Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) is a device that is intended to benefit patients by
            treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals in the United States
            per year, and where the effort of development generally does</p>
        <p>not yield a profit for manufacturers. An HDE allows a HUD to be used without the results of scientifically
            valid clinical investigation demonstrating that the device is effective for its intended purpose, but it
            must be used under certain conditions. (21 CFR 814 Subpart H)</p>
        <p><strong>Implant:</strong> a device that is placed into a surgically or naturally formed cavity of the human body if it is
            intended to remain there for a period of 30 days or more. FDA may, in order to protect public health,
            determine that devices placed in subjects for shorter periods are also &ldquo;implants&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><strong>Investigation:</strong> a clinical investigation or research involving one or more subjects to determine the safety
            or effectiveness of a device.</p>
        <p><strong>Investigational device:</strong> a device, including a &ldquo;transitional device,&rdquo; that is the object of an
            investigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Investigational Device Exemption (IDE):</strong> An approved IDE means that the FDA has approved the sponsor&rsquo;s
            IDE application for a clinical investigation involving a significant risk device.</p>
        <p><strong>Investigator:</strong> means an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation, i.e., under whose
            immediate direction the test article is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, a subject, or, in
            the event of an investigation conducted by a team of individuals, is the responsible leader of that team.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Monitor: </strong>an individual designated by a sponsor or contract research organization to oversee
            the progress of an investigation. The monitor may be an employee of a sponsor or a consultant to the
            sponsor, or an employee of or consultant to a contract research organization. <em>Monitor, </em>when used as
            a verb, means to oversee an investigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-invasive:</strong> a diagnostic device or procedure that does not by design or intention: (1) Penetrate or pierce
            the skin or mucous membranes of the body, the ocular cavity, or the urethra, or (2) enter the ear beyond the
            external auditory canal, the nose beyond the nostrils, the mouth beyond the pharynx, the anal canal beyond
            the rectum, or the vagina beyond the cervical os (opening of the cervix). Blood sampling that involves
            simple venipuncture, and the use of surplus samples of body fluids or tissues that are leftover from samples
            taken for non- investigational purposes, is also considered noninvasive.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-Significant Risk Device (NSRD):</strong> an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a
            significant risk device.(below) In some cases, these devices may be qualified for an Investigational Device
            Exemption.</p>
        <p>Significant risk device (SRD) means an investigational device that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare
                    of a subject;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a
                    potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or
                    otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the
                    health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> a person who takes responsibility for and initiates a clinical investigation. The sponsor may be an
            individual or pharmaceutical company, governmental agency, academic institution, private organization, or
            other organization. The sponsor does not actually conduct the investigation unless the sponsor is a
            sponsor-investigator. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to
            conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees
            are investigators.</p>
        <p><strong>Sponsor-Investigator:</strong> an individual who both initiates and conducts an investigation, and under whose
            immediate direction the investigational drug is administered or dispensed. The term does not include any
            person other than an individual. The requirements applicable to a sponsor-investigator under this part
            include both those applicable to an investigator and a sponsor.</p>
        <p><strong>Subject (e.g. Participant):</strong> a human who participates in an investigation, either as a recipient of the
            investigational new drug or as a control. A subject may be a healthy human or a patient with a disease.</p>
        <p><strong>Transitional device<em>: </em></strong>A device that was regulated by FDA as a new drug before May 28, 1976 before
            FDA classification systems were changed. An example of such a device is an intraocular lense. [21 CFR
            520(l)].</p>
        <p><strong>Unanticipated adverse device effect:</strong> any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening
            problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not
            previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application
            (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with
            a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
