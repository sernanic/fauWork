                        <u>Background</u>
                        <p>Federal regulations require researchers to promptly report to the IRB all serious adverse
                            events (SAEs) and
                            unanticipated problems (UPs) involving risk to human subjects or others that occur during an
                            IRB-approved research
                            protocol. In addition, researchers may need to report these events to the study sponsor,
                            institutional officials,
                            and the appropriate regulatory agencies, when applicable.

                        <u>Purpose</u>
                        <p>This policy provides researchers with guidance on reporting serious adverse events or
                            unanticipated problems
                            involving risk to human subjects or others during an IRB-approved research protocol.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <u>General Statement</u>
                        <p>Adverse events encompass both physical and psychological harms. They occur most commonly in
                            the context of biomedical
                            research, although they can and do occur in social- behavioral research. Many adverse events
                            are expected based on
                            previous studies in the literature, and are outlined in the informed consent document. These
                            do not need to be
                            reported to the IRB. However, if an adverse event is serious; unexpected in nature,
                            severity, and frequency; related
                            to the research, and a potential risk to human subjects or others, it meets the definition
                            of a “serious adverse
                            event.” Serious adverse events require a closer level of scrutiny and must be reported to
                            the IRB.
                            Similarly, “unanticipated problems” that are not physical or medical in nature can also
                            arise in the context of a
                            research study. For example, a breach of confidentiality or an error in how human subjects
                            data has been analyzed,
                            are both unanticipated problems that do not show up as a physical or psychological symptom
                            in the subject. However, if they are unexpected, and can potentially pose a risk to the
                            human subjects involved, or others, they must be reported to the IRB.<br />
                            Both serious adverse events and unanticipated problems, whether they occur in a clinical
                            trial, social/behavioral
                            research study, or other human subjects study, may signal that risks to subjects are greater
                            than expected. They may
                            also trigger modifications to the research protocol, informed consent, or other information
                            presented to the research
                            subjects. In some cases, they may even require that a study be suspended or terminated. In
                            order to make appropriate
                            decisions concerning the protection of human subjects in research, the IRB requires these
                            events to be reported
                            appropriately. The principal investigator (PI) of any research study under the jurisdiction
                            of the FAU IRB is
                            responsible for reporting these events.</p>

                        <p><strong>Adverse Event:</strong> any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human
                            subject, including any abnormal sign (for
                            example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory findings), symptom, or disease, temporally
                            associated with the
                            subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subjects’
                            participation in
                            research.
                        </p>
                        <p>Adverse events may be caused by one or more of the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>the procedures involved in the research;</li>
                            <li>an underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject; or</li>
                            <li>other circumstances unrelated to either the research or any underlying disease,
                                disorder,
                                or condition of the subject.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>In general, adverse events that are determined to be at least partially caused by (1) would
                            be considered related to participation in the research, whereas adverse events determined to
                            be solely caused by (2) or (3) would be considered unrelated to participation in the
                            research.</p>
                            <p><strong>Serious Adverse Event (SAE):</strong>Any adverse event occurring during the time period of a subject's

                        </ul>
                        <strong>Clinical Trials</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The development of cancer or the identification of a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject
                                who received a study drug is always reportable, even if the event occurs more than 30 days after the end of the
                                active intervention phase. The closing of a study does not terminate the PI’s obligation to report this serious
                                adverse event./li>
                            <li>All serious adverse events and unanticipated problems that occur during the performance of an investigator-initiated
                                clinical trial (i.e., a study that originated with an FAU investigator) must be reported to the IRB and to the FDA
                                if an IND (Investigational New Drug) or IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) has been obtained.</li>
                            <li>If an FAU PI coordinates a multi-site clinical trial, he/she should first send any report of a serious adverse event
                                or unanticipated problem to the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), unless otherwise stated in the IRB-approved
                                protocol. The DSMB (or an equivalent safety monitoring committee) for an IRB-approved research protocol plays a
                                significant part in the reporting of adverse events and unanticipated problems. Because of the volume of adverse
                                events-- ranging from serious to relatively minor in nature--the DSMB is responsible for reviewing these events,
                                determining their significance, and recommending changes to be made to the approved research protocol and/or consent
                                documents. If the DSMB receives a report(s) of an adverse event or unanticipated problem that represents serious
                                and/or unexpected events, the DSMB should send a report to the PIs and study sponsor in a prompt manner. It is the
                                responsibility of the PI to review the report and submit a Serious Adverse Event/Unanticipated Problem report to the
                                IRB within the appropriate timeframes listed in this policy. If there is no DSMB or equivalent monitoring committee
                                for an IRB-approved research protocol, the PI must review the event and determine whether it represents a serious
                                and/or unexpected event that should be reported to the IRB under this policy.</li>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
