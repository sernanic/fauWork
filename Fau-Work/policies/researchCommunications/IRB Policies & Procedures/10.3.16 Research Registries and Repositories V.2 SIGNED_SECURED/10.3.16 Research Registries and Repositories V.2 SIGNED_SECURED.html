        <u>Background</u>
        <p>Research registries and repositories are used to <strong>collect</strong>, <strong>maintain</strong>, and
            <strong>distribute </strong>data and/or human biological specimens (blood, tissues, cells, DNA, etc.) for
            some future research purpose. While some registries and repositories are created and maintained explicitly
            for research purposes, others can be for non-research purposes (such as medical care, education, normal
            operations) but may be accessed for future research.</p>
        <p>The purpose of establishing a formal research registry/repository is to give the investigator the authority
            and responsibility for distributing data and/or specimens from a registry or repository and to ensure that
            future uses are designed in a manner that protects the rights of research participants, supports scientific
            inquiry, and complies with Federal regulations. (45 CFR 46; 45 CFR 160-164; 21 CFR 50, 56, 812)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Purpose</u>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to outline IRB procedures for establishing, maintaining, and closing a research
            registry or repository at Florida Atlantic University (FAU).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This policy applies to human subjects research registries and repositories established by
                    investigators for collecting, maintaining, and distributing <strong>data and/or specimens
                    </strong><em>for research purposes</em>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This policy <strong>does not apply </strong>to data or/and specimens that are collected and stored as
                    part of routine clinical care or hospital procedures (for example, blood banks, pathology, disease
                    surveillance, or quality assurance) <em>unless the primary intent is for future research.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This policy applies to clinical research AND non-medical/non-clinical research maintained in
                    non-clinical settings for research use. (e.g., from social/behavioral studies)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>
                <p>All research registries and repositories at FAU require review and approval by the IRB.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The collection, maintenance and distribution of data or specimens (see definition of
                    &ldquo;specimens&rdquo; below) becomes a research registry or repository when there is a specific
                    intention for the data or/and specimens to be maintained for future research and/<strong>or
                    </strong>shared with other investigators.</p>
                <p>NOTE: The prospective collection and storage of data or specimens <u>for defined</u><u>research
                        purposes</u> (including holding samples to "batch" them for assays), as part of a single
                    IRB-approved protocol <strong>is not </strong>considered a &ldquo;registry&rdquo; or a
                    &ldquo;repository.&rdquo;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the PI has no explicit plan to destroy the data or/and specimens when an original research project
                    ends, the investigator may maintain the data or specimens under continued IRB approval for uses that
                    were approved in the original protocol. Once a use is desired <em>beyond the primary research goals
                        of the original protocol</em>, the PI must: 1) establish an IRB-approved research registry or
                    repository; 2) de-identify the data set for any future research uses with notification to the IRB
                    that this has occurred, OR 3) submit data or specimens into an existing IRB approved registry or
                    repository AND 4) close the original research project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Investigators wishing to use database information or biospecimens for research that differs in any
                    way from what is described in the IRB-approved protocol and applicable consent document(s)
                    <u><strong>MUST</strong></u> submit a new registry/repository protocol to the IRB following the
                    directives of this policy or amend the original protocol in a manner to account for the new use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For the purposes of this policy, a registry refers to the use of data and a repository refers to the
                    use of biological specimens and research materials. (See definitions below).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <u>Definitions</u>
        <p><strong>Anonymized Data or Biospecimens:</strong> Data or biological material that never had a code or other identifier
            assigned to it. There are no means to trace the data or samples back to an individual. FAU and some
            international standards consider IP addresses to be identifiable even though the address is linked to the
            computer and not specifically to the individual.</p>
        <p><strong>Coded:</strong> This term refers to specimens or data whose identifying information (such as name or social security
            number) has been replaced with a number, letter, symbol, or combination of these elements. Often there is a
            mechanism or &ldquo;key&rdquo; to decipher the code. Deciphering the code would enable someone to link the
            data or specimen or dataset to identifying information which could reveal the donor of the data or specimen
        </p>
        <p><strong>Confidential Data: </strong>information disclosed with the expectation that it will not be divulged without
            permission to others in ways inconsistent with the understanding of the original disclosure.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Usage Agreement:</strong> An agreement that details the conditions for receipt and future use of data and/or
            specimens from a registry or repository.</p>
        <p><strong>De-identified Data or Biospecimens &ndash;</strong> Data or biological material that has had all identifiers
            associated with human subjects removed in a manner that there is no reasonable basis to believe that
            information within the data or associated with the biological material that can be used to identify an
            individual. Investigator/research team cannot readily ascertain the identity of the individual, but the data
            was collected with identifiers.</p>
        <p><strong>Gatekeeper:</strong> A person(s) who has primary control of data and/or specimens and maintains the
            registry/repository. This person may be delegated by the Principal Investigator; however the PI retains
            ultimate responsibility for the oversight of the registry/repository.</p>
        <p><strong>Honest broker:</strong> An honest broker is an individual, entity or system, dedicated to collect and provide
            de-identified information/samples to the research team. In most cases, the honest broker individual/systems
            are outsiders, set up to obtain and provide clinical/medical records, data and specimens to researchers.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Identifiable private information:</strong> is private information for which the identity of the subject is or may
            readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information.</p>
        <p>Material Transfer Agreement: An agreement between FAU and another institution that allows one institution to
            share materials with another (e.g. tissues, etc.). This agreement protects the investigator and institution
            by notifying the recipient regarding materials that are patented and any limits on the use of samples and
            associated information.</p>
        <p><strong>Private information:</strong> Includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can
            reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided
            for specific purposes by an individual and</p>
        <p>that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (e.g., a medical record).</p>
        <p><strong>Protected Health Information (PHI): </strong>Individually identifiable health information collected from an
            individual that is: 1) Transmitted by electronic media 2) Maintained in electronic media; or 3) transmitted
            or maintained in any other form or medium by a HIPAA Covered Component. PHI encompasses information that
            identifies an individual or might reasonably be used to identify an individual and relates to the
            individual&rsquo;s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the
            provision of health care to the individual; or the past, present or future payment of heath care to an
            individual.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Identification Information (PII)</strong> <a
                href="http://www.fau.edu/research/research-integrity/research-data/rd-guidelines-" target="_blank">: As
                defined by Florida Statute 817.568(1) (f), under which fraudulent use is prohibited, PII means any name
                or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with other information, to identify a specific
                individual. For reference on examples of PII, see FAU Research Data Security guideline available at
            </a>http://www.fau.edu/research/research-integrity/research-data/rd-guidelines-
            definitions.php#collapseEight</p>
        <p><strong>Recruitment Registry:</strong> Lists of persons along with limited personal and, when applicable, medical
            information. The primary intent and use of these lists is to provide investigators with pools of contact
            information of potential study volunteers.</p>
        <p><strong>Registry: </strong><em>In general</em>, a registry is a collection of information elements or
            databases containing names, contact information, and personal records (medical, educational, attitudinal,
            survey answers, etc.). A data registry is a tool used to compile a set of individual subject/patient data
            that will be used <u>in the future</u> for analysis purposes. The organizers of the data registry receive
            information from multiple sources, maintain the information over time, control access to and use of the
            information by multiple individuals and/or for future multiple projects. IRB approval is required in advance
            of every time a registry is to be used for a new research purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Repository: </strong>A research repository provides a way for researchers to store human biological
            specimens (for example, blood, urine, tissue specimens obtained from biopsies, and tissues or organs removed
            during surgery) or materials (pictures, videos, audio recordings, etc.) and related information for
            <u>future research studies</u>. IRB approval is required every time a repository is planned to be used for a
            new research purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Research Database:</strong> A database is a collection of information elements (i.e. data) arranged for ease and
            speed of search and retrieval. The difference between a registry and a research database is based on the
            intent of use. A registry is intended to be used in future research, with a different scope of work and
            objectives. A research database, however, is used for one study and cannot be used to answer different
            research questions or research aims. Most databases are now maintained electronically, but the term can also
            be applied to paper record systems.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples of databases include the following:</strong> a set of observations (i.e., data) resulting from a research
            study<strong>, </strong>an electronic file containing patients' records<strong>, </strong>a collection of
            diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up information for a hospital's oncology patients.</p>
        <p><strong>Research Material:</strong> Tangible products obtained from the activities conducted in a research study. Research
            material can be human biospecimens, photos, videos, test documentation, or, research participant hard copy
            of the research records, among others.</p>
        <p><strong>Specimens:</strong> For purposes of this policy, specimens are human biological materials that range from subcellular
            structures and cell products such as DNA, to cells, tissue (e.g., blood, bone, muscle, connective tissue and
            skin), organs (e.g., liver, bladder, heart, kidney, placenta), secretions, and waste (e.g., hair or nail
            clippings, urine, feces, sweat, etc.).</p>
        <p><strong>Submittal Agreement:</strong> An agreement that attests that data/specimens collected were obtained with written
            informed consent of the subjects utilizing an informed consent document approved by the local IRB or under
            an IRB approved waiver of informed consent.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Written, or in writing, for purposes of this policy, refers to writing on a tangible medium (e.g.,
            paper) or in an electronic format</p>

                        <p>Use the protocol format for Recruitment Registries, Data Registry &amp; Repositories and
                            attach all requested information.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Include either a registry or repository consent OR a request for waiver of consent by the
                            IRB. (see &ldquo;Quick Guide&rdquo; below)</p>
                        <p>NOTE ABOUT CONSENT: Federal regulations (45 CFR 46.116) require researchers to describe the
                            nature and purposes of the research as well as both reasonably foreseeable and unforeseeable
                            risk of participation.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, informed consent for a registry or repository must be as clear as possible about
                            the range and types of future uses envisioned without being vague and open-ended.
                            Researchers should be sensitive to the concerns of special populations, issues surrounding
                            genetic research, and issues surrounding long-term storage of data on sensitive behaviors
                            that could cause stigma or affect the reputation, employability, or legal status of a
                            research participant.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If data or specimens are to be collected by or received from a &ldquo;covered entity&rdquo;
                            under HIPPA regulations, include the HIPAA authorization form that will be signed by
                            participants for the storage and future research use of their data or specimens, OR submit
                            the Waiver of HIPAA authorization request form. <u>Note:</u> Only certain FAU components are
                            covered by HIPAA requirements; check with Research Integrity or see <u>Guidance on HIPAA and
                                Research</u> if you are unsure.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The IRB will review the registry or repository protocol to ensure it adequately specifies the
                    conditions under which data and tissues may be accepted into the registry or repository. The IRB
                    will request standard operational procedures to guarantee the data or specimens will be securely
                    stored, and shared to protect the privacy of subjects, maintain the confidentiality of the data, and
                    preserve the integrity of specimens. Once these and other standard review concerns are addressed,
                    approval will be issued.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The protocol, should describe how individually identifiable data will be maintained separately from
                    the main database. If any identifiable data must be maintained (e.g. date of birth, date of
                    services, etc.) with the data set, the PI should provide a justification for doing so. This
                    information should be included in the consent form, and a data management plan submitted with the
                    protocol.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The protocol should describe the intended duration for maintaining a link between individually
                    identifiable data, the research data set and the process for destroying the link.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For protocols intending to use data for future research under a registry and repository consent, the
                    IRB would review the appropriateness of the process proposed for obtaining the consent, and ensure
                    that the required elements were appropriately included. Additionally, the IRB must determine that
                    consent is appropriately documented.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The IRB will also review the inclusion in the protocol of a procedure or strategy (i.e.: participants
                    log) to record the information of participants who consented or not to participate in the original
                    study and to use their data for future research.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Converting a research database to a registry:</strong>
        <p>Investigators may desire to use the data/specimens collected under a previously IRB approved study for
            different or future research purposes. Conversion of a research database to a registry or repository should
            consider the confidentiality, autonomy and benefit of the subjects who originally provided the data and/or
            specimens.</p>
        <p>Obtaining informed consent for research use of information or specimens beyond the original intention of the
            research or from non-research databases and repositories is usually challenging. Because future research use
            or a project with a different scope of work was not anticipated at the time of collection, future research
            consent may not have been obtained.</p>
        <p>Where it is possible to do so, IRBs&rsquo; may require researchers to obtain informed consent for future
            research of subjects involving information or specimens contained in a previous study or non-research
            databases or repositories.</p>
        <p>The IRB protocol should include the list of variables that will be in the data registry. A copy of the print
            screen of the database, listing all variables should be attached to the protocol. If identifiable data is
            included in the list of variables, the protocol should cover how this data will be maintained separately
            from the main research data base. If any identifiable data must be maintained, the PI should provide a valid
            justification and data management plan.</p>
        <p>If the PI cannot obtain consent of the participants for different reasons other than inconvenience or time
            restrictions &ndash; the PI must de-identify the data AND a waiver of consent should be submitted to the IRB
            describing the following processes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Detailed process for coding the data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Include an honest broker to conduct the process of de-identification.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Codes linking subjects to data: The protocol submitted to the IRB should cover who, if anyone, will
                    retain the key to the code linking subjects to identifiers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Explain the process to destroy the original research data set.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the research data set that will be converted to a registry or repository originated from a study approved
            by the IRB as a minimal risk study, the PI can apply for waiver of consent if:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                <p>The waiver of consent will not adversely affect subject&rsquo;s rights and welfare,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The research could not be practicably be carried out without the waiver, AND</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Where appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after
                    participation.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If researchers want to convert contact information data from a non-research dataset to a recruitment
            data set, the owner of the original data set (i.e. private practice office) should require
            permission from potential subjects before releasing contact information to researchers for
            recruitment purposes.</p>

        <strong>Maintaining a Research Registry/Repository</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The registry/repository must be maintained according to the protocol and SOPs submitted to
                    and approved by the IRB. As with all IRB protocols, any amendment to a registry or
                    repository protocol must be approved by the IRB before it is implemented.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the PI of a FAU registry or repository receives a request from an investigator to
                    <strong>distribute </strong>identifiable or de-identified data/specimens from an existing
                    research registry/repository, he/she must obtain a copy of that investigator&rsquo;s IRB
                    approval (if applicable) and confirmation that the investigator will comply with the
                    registry/repository&rsquo;s terms of usage. Note: If applicable, the recipient-investigator
                    may be asked to sign any type of agreement such as a Data Use Agreement or Material Transfer
                    Agreement, such agreements must be routed for review through Sponsored Programs and may
                    require consult with the Technology Development Office and /or Deputy General Counsel. See
                    Data Use Agreement Guideline available at: <a
                        href="https://www.fau.edu/research/sponsored-programs/files/FAU%20DUA%20Guidance%2002-10-2017.pdf"

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>At each continuing review, the PI of a FAU research registry or repository will be required
                    to provide a summary report to the IRB of all collections, distributions, and/or destruction
                    of data/specimens from the registry/repository.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When a PI no longer wishes to operate the registry or repository for future research, or if
                    the data/specimens are being transferred to another registry/repository, he/she should
                    submit a request for closure to the IRB. The closure request must include the disposition of
                    the data and specimens, including details on the secure transfer, donation and/or
                    destruction of data/specimens. Any inactive registry/repository should be responsibly closed
                    after 5 years. If a PI wishes to transfer the repository to another PI, a request for amendment should be submitted with the credentials of the new PI and endorsement of the College
                    Departmental Chair or Dean.(Note: PIs are advised to consult their IT representatives regarding the secure
                    management of all data/specimens.)</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <strong><u>Contributing to a Non-FAU Research Registry/Repository</u></strong>
        <p>If an FAU investigator wishes to contribute data/specimens to a registry or repository outside of FAU, the
            IRB must review, at a minimum, the IRB protocol used to collect the data/specimens, the consent process and
            the submittal agreement (see definition above).</p>
        <p>This allows the IRB to confirm that the data/specimens are authorized to be shared and used beyond the intent
            of the original research protocol. <u>Note:</u> Not all submissions to a research repository meet the
            federal definition of being engaged in human subject research. Contact the IRB office for further
            clarification.</p>
        <strong><u>Requesting Data/Specimens from a Research Registry/Repository</u></strong>
        <p>When an FAU investigator wishes to request coded or identifiable data from an established registry or
            repository inside or outside FAU, he/she should submit a request to the IRB either via a new protocol
            application or as an amendment to an existing study. The FAU IRB must review, at a minimum, the protocol,
            data collection tools, the usage agreement, data management plan, consent process (and any applicable a
            waiver), and obtain the IRB approval number of the registry/repository from which the request is being made.
        </p>
        <p>If the investigator wishes to request <em>anonymous </em>(and some coded) data, he/she may submit a request
            to the IRB for Determination of Non-Human Subjects Research using Form 6 and the Assessment tool 4 -
            Certificate of de-identification.</p>
        <p>Note: Certain registries or repositories may require the recipient to obtain a more stringent IRB review,
            even if the data appears to be de-identified. For example, if the repository contains data on sensitive or
            criminal behavior, the gatekeeper of the repository may request expedited or convened IRB review because the
            likelihood of the data causing harm in the event of a breach is significant to participants, even if the
            likelihood of the breach occurring is rare.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.fau.edu/research/sponsored-programs/review-" target="_blank">A Material Transfer
                Agreement (MTA) should be established between the institutions transferring/receiving the
                data/specimens. MTAs are contractual agreements used for the transfer or exchange of research materials
                both biological and non-biological to/from the university. All MTAs should be reviewed and approved by
                the Sponsored Programs Office and signed by both the PI and FAU&rsquo;s authorizing official prior to
                transferring the materials. More information about MTA is available at </a><a

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
