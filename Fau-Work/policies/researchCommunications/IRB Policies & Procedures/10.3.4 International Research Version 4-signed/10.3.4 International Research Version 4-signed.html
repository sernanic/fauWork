                        <u>Background</u>
                        <p>Florida Atlantic University (FAU) faculty and students conduct a diverse array of human
                            subjects research
                            projects, including studies in international settings.</p>

                    <li>
                        <u>Purpose</u>
                        <p>To clarify the Institutional Review Board&rsquo;s (IRB) position on international human
                            subjects research and
                            the additional ethical provisions that may apply in the ethical review of such research.</p>
                    </li>
                    <hr />
                    <li>
                        <u>General Statement</u>
                        <p>International human subjects research must adhere to FAU&rsquo;s policies and procedures as
                            well as those of
                            the host country, institution, or community. The Principal Investigator (PI) should endeavor
                            to design
                            research that is culturally appropriate, and which guarantees, at minimum, protections
                            equivalent to those
                            accepted in the U.S. All such international human subjects research carried out by FAU
                            investigators must be
                            reviewed by the University&rsquo;s human subjects review board.</p>
                        <p>FAU investigators conducting research with data from the EU must adhere to their
                            responsibilities established
                            by the European Union&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR regulates
                            the use, access,
                            collection, and processing of all personal data from the European Union, regardless of the
                            citizenship or
                            residency status of the individual to whom the data pertains.</p>
                        <p><a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/international/)" target="_blank">Some countries and
                                international
                                institutions have their own institutional review boards and regulations for human

                                (</a>http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/international/). In those</p>

                            approval, in addition
                            to approval by FAU&rsquo;s IRB, must be obtained before research can begin.</p>

                            students, will adhere
                            to applicable regulations at 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR 50 and 56, the Belmont Report, and other laws
                            as applicable.

                        <p>FAU&rsquo;s informed consent procedures still apply in international settings. Informed
                            consent documents
                            must be provided in the appropriate language, with a translated version provided to
                            FAU&rsquo;s IRB after
                            approval of the English version. A translator/interpreter may be</p>
                        <p>employed to help with the consent process. In some instances it may be appropriate for the
                            IRB to waive some
                            or all requirements for written consent. Research proposals for which this is requested
                            should include
                            explanations of cultural norms or conditions requiring such a waiver as well as proposed
                            alternative
                            consenting procedures.</p>

                                <p>When necessary, include in the IRB application package a letter of cooperation from
                                    local experts, a
                                    relevant institution, or authority for those international research sites for which
                                    there is no
                                    formal body comparable to an IRB. Ideally, this should be provided as part of the
                                    IRB submission; if
                                    for some reason it cannot, it should be submitted to the IRB as soon as possible
                                    after IRB approval.
                                </p>

                                    should be included as part of the IRB application package, and should include

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
