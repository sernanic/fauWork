        <u>Background</u>
        <p>Informed consent is one of the fundamental principles of ethical conduct in human subjects research. It is
            mandated by Federal regulations 45 CFR 46.116 and 46.117, as well as 21 CFR Subpart B. In addition, Florida
            Statutes will apply when they provide consent requirements above and beyond federal regulations.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Purpose</u>
        <p>To provide guidance to investigators and other authorized research personnel in obtaining and documenting
            informed consent when enrolling human subjects in research.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <p>All human subjects research conducted under the auspices of Florida Atlantic University shall comply with the
            provisions set forth in 45 CFR 46.116, 45 CFR 46.117, and 21 CFR Subpart B (for applicable studies)
            regarding informed consent.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>No investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by this policy unless the
                    investigator has obtained the informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized
                    representative. </strong>In seeking such consent, the investigator shall provide the prospective subject or
                    the subject&rsquo;s representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate
                    and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Unless a waiver is granted in accordance with 45 CFR 46.117(c), informed consent shall be documented
                    by the use of a written consent form approved by the IRB</strong>
                and signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A copy shall be given
                    to the person signing the form, and the original should be retained by the PI.</p>
            </li>  
            <li>
                <p><strong>The informed consent document(s) that the FAU PI submits to the IRB should be
                        tailored to the educational level and readability needs of participants</strong>, and
                    must include the <u>eight basic informed consent elements</u> as outlined in 45 CFR
                    46.116(a) (b), 21 CFR 50.25, and the FAU informed consent templates.</p>
            </li>
                
                <p>The basic informed consent elements are:</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve no penalty
                            or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may

                                    undue influence. Observation of the consent process may be performed by a member(s)
                                    of the IRB or IRB support staff, FAU auditor, a consent monitor appointed by the
                                    IRB, or by a third party hired by the Principal Investigator or Sponsor.
                                    **<em>Examples of when special monitoring may be required are</em>: a) during the
                                    enrollment of vulnerable populations; b) enrollment of individuals in situations of
                                    duress, or c) during the explanation of very complex studies with multiple

                                    parental permission are specifically outlined in this policy. Similarly, the FAU IRB
                                    shall be guided by its policy, Research Subjects with Cognitive Impairment, when

        <u>Procedures</u>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The PI should submit the IRB application package electronically via IRBNet. Note that no enrollment
                    or consenting of subjects can occur until after IRB approval has been granted for the protocol and
                    corresponding consents.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>As part of the IRB application package, the PI must include the informed consent documents most
                    appropriate for the study (e.g., an adult consent form for adult participants, a child assent for
                    child participants), and ensure the informed consent document is in a language and reading level
                    understandable to the participant or their</p>
                <p>representative. Further, the PI should take into account the medium through which informed consent
                    will be carried out (for example, in online environments) and tailor the consent process
                    appropriately. **Note: If the PI is not including a consent document that requires a signature, see
                    policy on Waiver of Informed Consent, for alternatives to the traditional informed consent form.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The PI should describe in the protocol how the informed consent process will be carried out.
                            Ensure the informed consent process provides sufficient opportunity for the participant or
                            the participant&rsquo;s legally authorized representative to consider whether or not to
                            participate.</p>

                    <li>

                            questions about the research; and c) someone that has been approved to act in this capacity
                            by the IRB.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>After obtaining IRB approval and as each participant is enrolled, the PI should ensure:</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>a) only the IRB approved informed consent document with a valid IRB approval stamp is used; b) the
                    consent document has valid IRB approval dates; c) the participant is provided a complete copy of the
                    consent document; and d) the consent documents are securely maintained in the Principal
                    Investigator&rsquo;s research records.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
