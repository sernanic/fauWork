                        <p>
                                Human subjects research in which university students will be asked to serve as research subjects is governed not only by
                                fundamental regulations under 45 CFR 46, and 21 CFR 50 and 812 (for FDA regulated studies) but also the Family
                                Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Department of Education’s 34 CFR Part 97.<br/><br/>
                                Title 34 provides the overall regulatory principles for human subjects research activities supported by the Department
                                of Education. FAU must ensure it is in compliance with Title 34 for those studies funded by the Department of Education.<br/><br/>
                                FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of personally identifiable information contained within a student’s
                                educational record. FERPA applies to all schools (K-12 including postsecondary institutions) that receive funds under
                                various programs from the U.S. Department of Education.<br/><br/>
                                Where applicable, researchers may choose to apply principles of professional societies and organizations, when they
                                provide protections above and beyond those of federal regulations.<br/><br/>

                        </p>

                        <u>Purpose</u>
                        <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance on conducting research studies in which university students will be
                            asked to be research participants within their educational setting.</p>
                    
                    </li>
                    <hr/>
                    <li><u>General Statement</u>
                        <p>
                            In some research situations, use of students is integral to a research protocol. This is particularly true of research
                            into teaching methods, curricula and other areas related to the scholarship of teaching and learning. In the social and
                            behavioral sciences course credit is commonly offered for research participation. <br/><br/>
                            An underlying principle of the regulations governing use of human subjects in research is that the subject’s
                            participation is voluntary and based upon full and accurate information. The student-teacher relationship raises the
                            issue of volunteer participation. For example, students may volunteer to participate in the belief that doing so will
                            place them in a favorable situation with an instructor (e.g., better grade, good recommendation, employment
                            possibilities), or that failure to participate will negatively affect their relationship with them (e.g. lower grade,
                            less favorable recommendation, being "uncooperative and not part of the scientific community).<br/><br/>
                            Instructors cannot mandate or require student participation and care should be taken to eliminate or reduce the risk
                            that they may unduly influence or coerce student participation in research. Instructors are strongly discouraged from
                            recruiting students they directly supervise or selecting subjects on such basis.<br/><br/>
                            Alternative assignments must be provided to students who decline from participating in research. Students should be
                            fully informed about the research requirements or alternatives and the compensation offered for their participation in
                            either one.

                                Students should be of the age of majority (18 years old in the State of Florida) in order to consent for themselves.
                                Research involving minors less than 18 years of age (even 17 year old college students) in most instances requires a
                                signed parental consent, as well as an assent from the student. (See IRB policy on Children in Research) however some
                                types of research may qualify for a Waiver of Parental Permission.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Researchers generally may not access classroom performance evaluations, grades, and information in a student’s records
                                without prior written permission from the student, regardless of the access a researcher may have in his/her academic
                                role.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the instructor is also the researcher, he/she should arrange to have the consents and/or data collected by an
                                independent third party when he/she is not present, so that he/she does not know who participated and does not have
                                access to the identifiable data or identity of participants for any purpose until grades have been assigned and entered.
                                (A teaching assistant in the class in which the student is enrolled does not qualify as a “third party” for collecting
                                the data on behalf of the researcher if they have a role in teaching and grading as well).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Whenever possible, researchers should avoid data collection during regular class meetings. Unless the research is
                                directly related to class material, or the study process is being used as a teaching opportunity, the IRB discourages
                                the use of class time to recruit subjects or class time used to complete study instruments.<br/><br/>
                                Loss of instructional time for both participants and non-participants may be considered a loss of benefits. Also, when
                                research participation is expected during the same session at which participation is invited, students may be unduly
                                influenced to take part due to peer pressure, perceived stigmatization from non-participation, or a sense of having
                                otherwise wasted time by attending that day’s class. The use of class time for research purposes must be justified.

                                <strong>When course credit or extra credit is given to students who participate in research, non-research alternative
                                    assignments should be provided to students who do not wish to participate in the research to ensure students are not
                                    unduly influenced into participating in the research study.

                                    <li>Alternative assignments could include, for example, short papers, special projects, book reports, and brief quizzes on additional readings, research seminars, or completing a similar project.</li>
                                    <li>The alternative assignment should require approximately the same time and effort commitment as research participation and earn the same amount of credit.</li>
                                    <li>Instructors should make every effort to ensure that they do not exert undue influence on students to participate in research rather than the alternative assignment</li>
                                    <li>The consent form and any recruitment material should clearly describe the alternative assignment in a way and at a time that allows the students to make an informed choice about which method they will use to earn credit.</li>

                                Recruitment of student subjects for research must be done in a non-coercive manner. To avoid undue influence, subjects
                                should be recruited by a general announcement, central posting or announcement mechanism that should include a clearly
                                written description of the project and a statement of the proposed student participation. Special precautions need to be
                                taken to ensure that there is no undue coercion, and to ensure that student’s don’t feel that if they don’t participate
                                they will be punished or receive a lower grade. In addition to being provided with the traditional information and
                                consent forms, the student should also be provided with the name and contact information of a neutral third party to
                                contact should they feel coerced at any time during the process.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Since there are special risks of confidentiality in the close environment of the university, special attention should be
                                given to full disclosure of these risks when obtaining the student’s consent to participate. The plan for handling
                                research data should be designed to minimize the risk that confidentiality will be breached. When instruments call for
                                the disclosure of information which participants may view as personal or sensitive, data should be collected in a manner
                                that minimizes the chance of one participant learning the response of another. Procedures for data storage, data coding,
                                retention, and security should be described in the protocol. If survey data collection is anonymous or if there is an
                                intention to code the survey data, researchers should remove from the survey document’s requests for the participants’
                                names and significant identifying information. To the extent possible, PIs should limit the involvement and scope of
                                multiple, junior level research assistants in projects involving sensitive topics. Student researchers are likely to
                                have outside of research contact with their peers which may expand the potential for breach of confidentiality.
                                Researchers should be sensitive to these issues when writing their research protocol.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Students must be allowed to withdraw from the study at any time. The informed consent statement should make clear the
                                consequences of withdrawing from a study prior to completion. In general it is favorable to give credit if the subject
                                withdraws, unless the student withdraws immediately or there is evidence of bad faith on the part of the student.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the research is one where data are collected from a group project or perhaps an audio- or videotape of the group
                                interaction, each student’s consent is necessary for the use of that data in the research. If one student does not
                                consent, the data may be used only if the non-consenting student’s data can be effectively excluded. Special data
                                storage considerations should be given to protecting the confidentiality of video and audio research data, including
                                encryption measures and secure, locked physical storage locations.

                                Students have the right to full disclosure as soon as possible. Whenever possible a teaching opportunity in the form of
                                an "educational debriefing" should be employed. Students should know something about the rationale for the study, the
                                process of data collection, and intent of the researcher. In exceptional circumstances, the full or true purpose of the
                                research may not be revealed to the subjects until the completion of data collection. In such cases, students must not
                                be subjected to undue stress or embarrassment and must have the right to full disclosure of the purpose of the study as
                                soon as possible after the data have been collected. During the debrief students should be given an opportunity to
                                decide whether the researcher(s) can use the data collected.

                                Research involving departmental units that maintain their own subject pools must be coordinated appropriately with the
                                subject pool administrator. In addition, use of the subject pool and provision of subject pool credits must be
                                adequately described in the IRB protocol. To ensure that students are fully informed about the research requirements for
                                a course and the compensation offered for their participation, the department should specify how many hours or units of
                                research participation are required for the course, the alternative assignment that students can complete in lieu of the
                                research, and the consequences of not showing up for or completing a research study.

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
