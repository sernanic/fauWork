        <u>Background</u>
        <p>Florida Atlantic University faculty and students conduct a diverse array of human subject research projects,
            including clinical studies that involve marketed and investigational new drugs and biologics. Human subject
            research involving new drugs or biologics must be in compliance with relevant Food and Drug Administration
            (FDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) laws and regulations. 45 CFR 46 requires all human
            subject research to undergo Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and to have informed consent provisions.
            FDA regulations under 21 CFR 312 Subpart D require the same, but also impose other regulatory
            responsibilities on investigators and sponsors. Investigators planning, designing and implementing clinical
            trials involving drugs or biologics need to be aware of these FDA, DHHS and FAU requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Purpose</u>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to ensure that studies conducted by FAU faculty are in compliance with FDA and
            DHHS regulations and good clinical practices (GCP), and to ensure the protection and welfare of human
            research participants involved in clinical investigations of new drugs and/or biologics. In addition, this
            policy is intended to assist FAU faculty who plan to submit a protocol and conduct human subject research
            that uses an investigational new drug or biologic as part of treatment or therapy, or use an approved
            marketed drug for an unapproved use or utilization of a different route of administration or dose, about
            relevant FDA and DHHS laws and regulations.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <p>Prior to the administration of a) an investigational new drug or biologic, or b) an approved marketed drug
            (or biologic) for unapproved use, or c) an approved drug (or biologic) used with a different route of
            administration or in an unapproved dose, a Principal Investigator or sponsor must request and obtain an
            Investigational New Drug (IND) Application or Biologics License Application (BLA) from the FDA. An IND may
            be submitted for one or more phases of an investigation. Otherwise, a justification and documentation that
            use of the drug/biologic meets the requirements for an exemption from the IND requirements must be provided.
        </p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <p>All ongoing and proposed clinical trials conducted by FAU faculty that use investigational drugs or biologics
            must be fully compliant with all FDA and DHHS regulations. The Institutional Review Board of record will
            review all clinical research protocols involving drugs or biologics for evidence of compliance with the
            applicable laws and regulations.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Definitions</u>
        <p><strong>Biologic: </strong>A biologic (e.g. biological product) includes any virus, therapeutic serum, toxin,
            antitoxin or similar product applicable to the prevention, treatment or cure of human diseases or injuries.
            The term includes a biological product that is used <em>in vitro </em>for diagnostic purposes. (21 CFR
            600.3)</p>
        <p><strong>Clinical Investigation:</strong> Any experiment in which a drug is administered to, dispensed to, or used involving
            one or more human subjects. An experiment is any use of a drug except for the use of a marketed drug in the
            course of medical practice (21 CFR 312.3).</p>
        <strong>Phases of an investigation</strong>
        <p>The clinical investigation of a previously untested drug is generally divided into three phases (21 CFR
            312.21):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Phase 1 </strong>studies include the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans.
                Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer
                    subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the
                    drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early
                    evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug's pharmacokinetics
                    and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well- controlled,
                    scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. The total number of subjects and patients included in Phase 1
                    studies varies with the drug, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.</p>
                <p>Phase 1 studies also include studies of drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and
                    mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as
                    research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Phase 2</strong> includes the controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug
                    for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and
                    to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies
                    are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in</p>
                <p>a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Phase 3 </strong>studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after
                    preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to
                    gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the
                    overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician
                    labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include from several hundreds to several thousands of subjects.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Drug:</strong> As defined by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, drugs are articles (other than food) intended for the
            use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals, or to
            affect the structure or any function of the body in man or other animals.</p>
        <p><strong>Investigational New Drug (IND):</strong> A drug or biologic that does not have an approved marketing application and
            is used in a clinical investigation. This includes marketed drugs being studied at new doses, routes of
            administration or indications that do not appear in the product label. "IND" is synonymous with "Notice of
            Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Drug and also means an investigational new drug application (21
            CFR 312.2).</p>
        <p><strong>Investigator</strong>: Under FDA definitions, an individual who actually conducts a clinical
            investigation (<em>i.e.</em>, under whose immediate direction the drug is administered or dispensed to a
            subject). In the event an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the
            responsible leader of the team. "Sub-investigator" includes any other individual member of that team.</p>
        <p><strong>Marketing Application:</strong> An application to market a new drug or a biologics license application for a
            biological product after it has been clinically tested. This includes a New Drug Application (NDA) or
            Biologics License Application (BL A). A BLA is a request to FDA for permission to introduce, or deliver for
            introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce (21 CFR 601.2).</p>
        <p><strong>Sponsor: </strong>A person who takes responsibility for and initiates a clinical investigation. The sponsor may be an
            individual or pharmaceutical company, governmental agency, academic institution, private organization, or
            other organization. The sponsor does not actually conduct the investigation unless the sponsor is a
            sponsor-investigator. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to
            conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees
            are investigators.</p>
        <p><strong>Sponsor-Investigator:</strong> An individual who both initiates and conducts an investigation, and under whose
            immediate direction the investigational drug is administered or dispensed. In some instances, clinical
            investigations subject to FDA regulation are initiated by an individual rather than a company or corporate
            entity.</p>
        <p><strong>Subject (Participant):</strong> A human who participates in an investigation, either as a recipient of the
            investigational new drug or as a control. A subject may be a healthy human or a patient with a disease.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> <u>Accountability</u> (responsibilities for PI and sponsor are outlined under 21 CFR 312 subpart D unless otherwise
            indicated)</p>
        <strong>The Principal Investigator will be responsible for:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Not initiating the clinical investigation before obtaining all necessary approvals, specifically the

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The PI must initiate the required IND or BLA documentation prior to submitting an IRB application
                    package to the IRB of record. Researchers are strongly encouraged to contact FDA to obtain further
                    guidance prior to the submission of an IND (or BLA) application, especially if they are uncertain
                    about the proposed study&rsquo;s regulatory status.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <p>The PI and study team must obtain good clinical practices (GCP) training via CITI or another FAU

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
