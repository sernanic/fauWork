        <u>Background</u>
        <p>The Human Research Protections Program (HRPP) at Florida Atlantic University is governed by several guiding
            principles and laws.</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                <p> <strong>Ethical Principles.</strong>  The primary ethical principles applied to research governed by the HRPP are those
                    stated in the Belmont Report. The three main principles are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Respect for persons (including obtaining informed consent, giving consideration to privacy
                            and confidentiality and adding protections for vulnerable populations);</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Beneficence (applied by weighing risks and benefits); and</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Justice (applied by the equitable selection of subjects).</p>
                        
                                        
                        <p>Other appropriate ethical standards may be applied to research governed by
                            the HRPP in certain circumstances if they are recognized by the federal or
                            other funding source or the state or country where the research will occur.
                        </p>

        <u>Purpose</u>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to ensure the protection and welfare of human subjects participating in
            research engaged in by FAU.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <p>Florida Atlantic University promotes the highest code of conduct for research involving human subjects to
            adequately protect the rights and welfare of human subjects participating in that research. FAU is committed
            to developing, implementing and maintaining a systematic and comprehensive HRPP with appropriate leadership
            and monitoring. The President of the University and the Vice President of Research have overall
            responsibility for FAU&rsquo;s HRPP. The Vice President of Research is the designated &ldquo;institutional
            official&rdquo; (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;IO&rdquo;) who delegates shared responsibility for the HRPP
            to the Director of Research Integrity. Additionally, the IRB has oversight of all policies, procedures and
            practices relating to institutional review of proposed new protocols, informed consent, protocol data and
            safety monitoring, management of financial conflicts and financial disclosure. This policy describes the
            essential elements of FAU&rsquo;s plan for implementing, maintaining and monitoring the HRPP.</p>
        <strong>Activities to which the HRPP Applies</strong>
        <p>FAU's HRPP applies to all research involving human subjects engaged in by the University (Note: this includes
            student projects that meet the definition of research, but does not apply to student projects designed
            exclusively for instructional purposes).</p>
        <strong>Research shall be considered &ldquo;human subjects research&rdquo; if it satisfies any of the following
            criteria:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>It is a "clinical investigation" involving "human subjects" as defined in United States Food and Drug
                    Administration ("FDA") regulations (21 CFR Section 50.3);</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is "research" involving "human subjects" as defined in United States Department of Health and
                    Human Services ("DHHS") regulations or other Common Rule regulations (45 CFR Section 46.102);</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is research subject to Department of Defense (DOD) or Department of Education regulations for the
                    protection of human subjects (32 CFR Part 219 and 34 CFR Part 97).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is research involving human subjects under any other applicable state or local laws or
                    regulations.</p>
               
            </li>
            <strong>Human subjects research becomes subject to the HRPP whenever one or more of the following conditions
                occurs:</strong>
            <li>
                <p>FAU&rsquo;s employees or agents observe, intervene or interact with human subjects for purposes of
                    research under the auspices of the University;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FAU&rsquo;s employees or agents obtain individually identifiable private information about human
                    subjects for purposes of research under the auspices of the University;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FAU receives a direct award from any source to conduct research involving human subjects, even where
                    all activities involving human subjects are carried out by a subcontractor or collaborator;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The research involves human subjects and the researchers recruit those subjects from the University,
                    including using the University's public information to identify and contact potential research
                    subjects, or uses any of its property or facilities;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There is an emergency use of investigational drug, device or biologic under FDA regulations by an
                    employee or agent of FAU: or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FAU's IRB is the IRB of record for the research even though conducted or supplied by another
                    institution.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <p>It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University (&ldquo;FAU&rdquo; or &ldquo;University&rdquo;) that the
            rights and welfare of human subjects participating in research engaged in by FAU must be adequately
            protected. All such research, including research projects, theses, or dissertations, whether unfunded or
            funded by grants, contracts, or other mechanisms, must satisfy each of the following requirements:</p>
        <p>I. It must be guided by applicable ethical principles including respect for persons, beneficence and justice
            as described in &ldquo;The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human
            Subjects of Research&rdquo; of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical
            and Behavioral Research ("Belmont Report");</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>It must comply with applicable laws and regulations;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It must be conducted by persons with appropriate expertise and training;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It must have scientific or scholarly merit;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It must be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted institutional review board (IRB) that
                    functions independently of other FAU administrative or scientific units with respect to protecting
                    the rights and welfare of human research subjects. This requirement may be satisfied through an
                    expedited IRB review process if permitted under applicable law and FAU policy.</p>
                     <p>Research subject to the HRPP may not proceed without IRB approval even if it has been approved by other FAU
            departments or officials. The ability to effectively protect the rights and welfare of human subjects
            participating in FAU research depends on the willingness of those involved in such research to personally
            adhere to the standards described in this policy and to report suspected noncompliance with this policy. It
            is the obligation of all FAU employees to report any suspected or confirmed noncompliance with the HRPP to
            FAU's IRB, the Chair of the IRB HRPP, the Director of Research Integrity, or the General Counsel through
            regular organizational channels.</p>
        <p>Principal investigators and others who design, conduct or are engaged in research involving human subjects
            are expected to be familiar with this policy and FAU's HRPP. PIs and others must be trained and educated
            with regards to all aspects of research involving human subjects, and accept continuing responsibility for
            compliance with this policy and the HRPP through all stages of the research process.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
