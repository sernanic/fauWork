        <u>Background</u>
        <p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (also known as HIPAA) went into effect in
            2003. HIPAA is a federal law that establishes national standards for protecting the privacy and security of
            <strong>protected health information (PHI) </strong>and defines specific rights for individuals with respect
            to their PHI.</p>
        <p>Updates to HIPAA, known as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH),
            went into effect in March 2013. The HITECH Act includes a number of measures designed to broaden the scope
            and increase the rigor of HIPAA compliance and strengthens the privacy and security protection of individual
            health information. HITECH specifically requires that patients be notified in the event of a breach of
            privacy or security, and establishes penalties for non- compliance with HIPAA.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Purpose</u>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to outline the conditions under which FAU faculty, staff, students, residents,
            and post-doctoral fellows (collectively &ldquo;FAU faculty, staff and students) as well as non-employees may
            obtain, create, use or disclose <strong>PHI </strong>for research purposes. PHI refers to individually
            identifiable health information (oral, written, or electronic) that is created or received by a
            &ldquo;covered component&rdquo; and that relates to an individual&rsquo;s physical or mental health, or the
            provision of health care to an individual or payment for their health care.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <p>Florida Atlantic University (FAU) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of PHI, while at the
            same time ensuring that researchers continue to have access to the medical information necessary to conduct
            research. Accordingly, research must be conducted in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and
            University policies.</p>
        <p>As noted above, HIPAA applies specifically to certain &ldquo;covered components&rdquo; (as defined in
            appendix A). FAU is a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; covered entity which means only certain components of the
            university (Student Health Services, College of Medicine, College of Nursing clinics) meet the federal
            definition of a covered entity. While only certain covered components at FAU must have formal HIPAA
            compliance programs, it is the expectation that <u>al</u>l FAU faculty, staff and students have an awareness
            of HIPAA and how it may affect them as they work with PHI for research purposes.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>At FAU all research that is conducted using PHI from patients of a covered component must be
                    conducted in accordance with HIPAA privacy and security regulations as well as relevant state laws
                    and regulations. If state of Florida laws provide greater privacy protections or rights with respect
                    to a patient&rsquo;s PHI, then state laws supersede HIPAA.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>As a general policy, faculty, staff and students of an FAU covered component must obtain
                    authorization from all participants in a research study prior to the internal use or external
                    disclosure of PHI unless he/she obtains a waiver of authorization.</p>
                <p>However, a member of a covered component at FAU is authorized to use or disclose, for research
                    purposes, health information which has been appropriately <strong>de- identified </strong>as
                    outlined in 45 CFR 164.502(d) and 164.514(a)-(c) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>With regard to PHI, FAU faculty, staff and students conducting research should strive to use the
                    &ldquo;<strong>minimum necessary</strong>&rdquo; information whenever possible. For example,</p>
                <p>researchers should not request an Individual&rsquo;s entire medical record unless the entire medical
                    record is justified as reasonably necessary to accomplish the research objectives.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All faculty, staff, or students who use PHI for research purposes must complete appropriate HIPAA
                    training via the Collaborative Inter-Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) site. CITI&rsquo;s
                    Health Information Privacy and Security (HIPS) materials cover the principles of data protection,
                    focusing on the healthcare-related privacy and information security requirements of the Health
                    Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Additional training related to Covered
                    Component requirements may also be required by the institution and must be followed as applicable.

        <p>Procedures</p>
        <p>For persons who are FAU faculty, staff or students of a Covered Component (Student Health, College of
            Medicine, College of Nursing) and persons that are not members of a covered component but who wish to obtain
            PHI for research purposes1, the following procedures apply:</p>
        <h3>Research Using De-Identified Health Information:</h3>
        <p>To use or disclose &ldquo;de-identified&rdquo; data for research purposes, the following is required:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The patient data must be de-identified using one of the following methods:</p>
                <p> <strong>The Safe Harbor Method:</strong>  Remove the 18 key identifiers from the PHI dataset. This can be done by the
                    workforce members of the Covered Component (e.g., clinic, hospital, etc.) and documented via the
                    Assessment Tool 2: Am I Using PHI (De-Identification Certification Form), or through the services of
                    an Honest Broker (see definition in Appendix A below). If the Covered Component wishes to use the
                    services of the Honest Broker, they must enter into a Business Associate Agreement with that
                    person/entity prior to this service. OR</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Expert Determination: </strong>Obtain documentation that a statistician (or other person with appropriate
                    knowledge and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles for rendering
                    information not individually identifiable) has determined that the risk is minimal that the
                    information could be used, alone or in combination with other available information, to identify the
                    person who information is being used.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Covered Component providing the data is permitted to assign and retain a code to allow the
                    re-identification of PHI. However, the code cannot be derived from or related to the information
                    about the subject. (e.g., the</p>
                <p>subject&rsquo;s initials and last 4 digits of their social security number cannot be used). Also, the
                    Covered Component cannot disclose the re-identification code or the method of re-identifying the PHI
                    to the researchers or to anyone else.</p>
                <h3>Research Use/Disclosure with Individual Authorization:</h3>
                <p>To use or disclose PHI with authorization by the research participant, the following is required:</p>
                <p>1 *In situations where FAU personnel obtain PHI from Covered Components outside of the university
                    (hospitals, nursing homes, mental health facilities, doctors&rsquo; offices, etc.) the same general
                    procedures apply but researchers may follow the institution-specific procedures of that Covered
                    Component unless the Covered Component does not have an IRB, Privacy Board, or Privacy
                    Office/official that conducts such reviews.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Prepare and submit, as part of the IRB submission package, either the standalone HIPAA
                            Authorization Form or the combined Consent Form/Authorization (see templates in IRBNet).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Obtain an additional, separate authorization if the research involves the use or disclosure
                            of psychotherapy notes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Maintain an accounting of PHI disclosed for research purposes so that an individual who
                            requests this data can see to whom and how often their PHI has been disclosed. This
                            accounting must include disclosures of PHI that occurred during the six years prior to an
                            individual's request for an accounting in general. (See 45 CFR 164.528) As part of the
                            study, if you collect PHI from more than fifty subjects, you may use a simpler Modified
                            Accounting System as referenced in Definitions below. (45 CFR 164.528)</p>
                        <h3>Research Use/Disclosure <u>without</u> Authorization: </h3>(For example, to conduct medical
                            records research, a waiver may be appropriate when researchers are unable to use
                            de-identified information, and the research could not practicably be conducted if research
                            participants' authorization were required.) 45 CFR 164.512(i)(1)(i)
                        <p>To use or disclose PHI without authorization by the research participant, the following is
                            required:</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Submit a request to the IRB/Privacy Board for waiver or alteration of the authorization
                            requirement using <u>Form 7, Request for Waiver of HIPAA Authorization Requirement</u> as
                            part of the IRB submission package. The responses on the form should contain thoughtful and
                            substantive responses to the criteria for a waiver or alteration of authorization as
                            outlined on the form and in the federal regulations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Obtain documentation from the IRB/Privacy Board that an alteration, or waiver of
                            authorization, for use or disclosure of a research participant's PHI has been approved.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Note: If a Covered Component uses or discloses PHI based on an IRB approved waiver or
                            alteration of the authorization requirement, the covered entity must retain the IRB&rsquo;s
                            documentation on which it relied for at least 6 years from the date the waiver or alteration
                            was obtained, or the date when it was last in effect, whichever is later. (&sect;
                            164.316(b)(2)(i)).</p>
                        <h3>Review of PHI as Preparation for Research:</h3>
                        <p>To obtain PHI solely as preparation for research (e.g., to design a research study, assess
                            the feasibility of conducting a study, or to prepare a grant application), the following is
                            required:</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Submit the Request to use PHI Preparatory to Research to the primary privacy contact of the
                            Covered Component. Ensure the request addresses the required elements outlined in 45 CFR
                            164.512(i)(1)(ii) including a) that the use or disclosure of the PHI is solely to prepare a
                            research protocol or for similar purposes preparatory to research, b) that the researcher
                            will not remove any PHI from the covered entity, and c) that the PHI for which access is
                            sought is necessary for the research purposes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Obtain documented approval prior to conducting these activities and submit a copy along with
                            your IRB submission. Also, submit as appropriate to the Privacy Officer and/or person
                            responsible for release of medical information in the unit.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Review of PHI to Recruit Research Participants:</h3>
                <p>To obtain PHI to contact potential research participants, the following is required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you are the treating health care provider/staff, you may review patient records to
                            identify prospective research participants, and contact them to discuss the research
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Submit the Request to use PHI Preparatory to Research to the primary privacy contact of the
                            Covered Component.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you are NOT the treating health care provider/staff, you may review patient records to
                            identify prospective research participants using the review of PHI preparatory to research
                            mechanism. However, it is preferred that the treating health care provider contact them to
                            discuss the research opportunity.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, and with justification, the IRB may approve a method where contact is made
                            jointly by the researcher and treating provider, or by the researcher referring the primary
                            health care provider in the initial contact with the patient. The goal is to ensure
                            recruitment is done in a manner that is the least intrusive to an individual&rsquo;s
                            privacy.</p>
                        <p>In these cases, the researcher must either obtain a signed Authorization form, or request and
                            obtain a Partial Waiver of Authorization, to use PHI to contact a covered component&rsquo;s
                            patients as part of the overall IRB application. The request should be accompanied by a
                            letter of cooperation indicating that the treating health provider has agreed to this
                            method.</p>
                        <p>If the researcher also needs to screen potential research participants for eligibility after
                            contacting them, and that involves soliciting health information to ensure they</p>
                        <p>meet inclusion criteria, this should be included in the authorization or waiver of
                            authorization request submitted to the IRB.</p>
                        <h3>Research on the Protected Health Information of Decedents</h3>
                        <p>To conduct research on the Protected Health Information of decedents (deceased persons):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Submit a request to use PHI of decedents to the primary privacy contact of the
                                    Covered Component.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Ensure the request addresses the required elements outlined in 45 CFR
                                    164.512(i)(1)(iii), including that the use or disclosure being sought is solely for
                                    research on the PHI of decedents, that the PHI being sought is necessary for the
                                    research and, at the request of the Covered Component, documentation of the death of
                                    the individuals about whom information is being sought.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Obtain documented approval from the primary privacy contact of the Covered Component
                                    stating that the request has been approved and meets the requirements of the federal
                                    regulations (45 CF 164.512(i)(1)(iii)). Submit as appropriate to the Privacy Officer
                                    and/or person responsible for release of medical information in the unit.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>As set forth under the privacy rule, individually identifiable health information of
                                    a person who has been deceased for more than 50 years <u>is not</u> PHI.</p>
                                <h3>Research with a Limited Data Set</h3>
                                <p>A limited data set excludes all direct identifiers of the individual or his/her
                                    relatives, employers, or household members, EXCEPT <strong>dates </strong>directly
                                    related to an individual and <strong>town, city, state, zip code</strong>. (See

                                <p>A data use agreement or &ldquo;DUA&rdquo; (see FAU template found in IRBNet) must be
                                    entered into by both the Covered Component and the researcher, so that the Covered
                                    Component may disclose a limited data set to the researcher for research, public
                                    health, or health care operations.</p>

                                    to disclose PHI to these external parties if they enter into a Business Associate
                                    Agreement (BAA) that obligates the business associate to take appropriate steps to

                                    Business Associates is for recruitment or protocol development. A business associate
                                    may need to access PHI to assist them with identifying or contacting study
                                    participants, or to help design a research protocol. Contact Research Integrity or

<p><strong>Breach:</strong> The unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information, which compromises
    the security or privacy of such information. Data breaches may involve personal health information (PHI), personally
    identifiable information (PII), trade secrets, or intellectual property.</p>
<p><strong>Business Associate: </strong>Generally an entity or person who performs a function involving the use or disclosure of
    Protected Health Information (PHI) on behalf of a covered entity (such as claims processing, case management,
    utilization review, quality assurance, billing) or provides services for a covered entity that require the
    disclosure of PHI (such as legal, actuarial, accounting, accreditation). For example, an individual or company hired
    by an investigator (who is part of a covered entity) to review PHI to identify and recruit potential research
    subjects would be a &ldquo;business associate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Clearinghouse</strong>: Health care clearinghouse means a public or private entity, including a billing service, re-pricing
    company, community health management information system or community health information system, and
    &ldquo;value-added&rdquo; networks and switches, that does either of the following functions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Processes or facilitates the processing of health information received from another entity in a nonstandard
            format or containing nonstandard data content into standard data elements or a standard transaction.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Receives a standard transaction from another entity and processes or facilitates the processing of health
            information into nonstandard format or nonstandard data content for the receiving entity.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Covered Component: </strong>Components of a covered entity that engage in 'covered functions' and, any component that engages
    in activities that would make it a 'business associate' of a component that performs covered functions if the two
    components were separate legal entities.</p>
<p><strong>Covered Entity:</strong> A health plan, a health care provider, or a health care clearinghouse who transmits any health
    information in electronic form in connection with a transaction covered by the Privacy Rule.</p>
<p>There are three Covered Entities at FAU: 1) the College of Medicine; 2) the College of Nursing (including the
    Community Health Center (CHC) and Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center (MWC)); and 3) Student Health
    Services and Pharmacy.</p>
<p><strong>Covered Functions:</strong> Activities of a covered entity, the performance of which makes the entity a health plan, a health
    care provider, or a health care clearinghouse.</p>
<p><strong>Data Use Agreement:</strong> An agreement or contract, which serves as satisfactory assurance that the recipient of a limited
    data set will only use or disclose the protected health information for limited purposes. A data use agreement
    between the covered entity and the limited data set recipient must:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Establish the permitted uses and disclosures by the recipient of information in the limited data set. The
            data use agreement may not authorize the limited data set recipient to use or further disclose the
            information in a manner that would violate the requirements of the privacy rules;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Establish who is permitted to use or receive the limited data set; and</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Provide that the limited data set recipient will:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                <p>Not use or further disclose the information other than as permitted by the data use agreement or as
                    otherwise required by law;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use appropriate safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of the information other than as provided for
                    by the data use agreement;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Report to the covered entity any use or disclosure of the information not provided for by its data
                    use agreement of which it becomes aware;</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>De-Identified Data:</strong>  Data (containing health information) that does not identify an individual and with respect to
    which there is no reasonable basis to believe that information within the data can be used to identify an
    individual. Consistent with the Privacy Rule, health information is considered de-identified: 1) upon the removal of
    a list of eighteen (18) direct identifiers defined under HIPAA that could be used to identify an individual; 2) if
    an expert, who can determine and document, using generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and
    methods, that there is a very small risk that the information used alone or in combination with other reasonably
    available information could be used to identify the subject of the information. The 18 identifiers are as follows:
    1) Names; 2) All geographic subdivisions smaller than a State, including street address, city, county, precinct, zip
    code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code if, according to the current
    publicly available data from the Census Bureau: (a) The geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the
    same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and (b) The initial three digits of a zip code for all
    such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000; 3) All elements of dates (except year)
    for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death;
    and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and
    elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older; 4) Telephone numbers; 5) Fax numbers; 6)
    Electronic mail addresses; 7) Social security numbers; 8) Medical record numbers; 9) Health plan beneficiary
    numbers; 10) Account numbers; 11) Certificate/license numbers; 12) Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including
    license plate numbers; 13) Device identifiers and serial numbers; 14) Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs); 15)
    Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers; 16) Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints; 17) Full face
    photographic images and any comparable images; and 18) Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code,
    except as permitted by item #3.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
