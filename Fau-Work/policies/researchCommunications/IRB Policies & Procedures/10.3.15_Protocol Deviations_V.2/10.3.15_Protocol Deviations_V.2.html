        <u>Background</u>
        <p>Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46.104 (b)(4)(iii), 21 CFR 56.108 (a) (4)] and ICH 3.3.7 (which governs Good
            Clinical Practices in research) require that changes to previously approved research be reviewed and
            approved by the IRB <u>before</u> being implemented, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate
            hazards to human subjects. Any change to a research protocol that is carried out without IRB approval is
            considered a protocol deviation.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Purpose</u>
        <p>This policy outlines investigator responsibilities for reporting protocol deviations associated with an IRB
            approved protocol at FAU.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <p>FAU investigators are responsible for ensuring that their human subjects research protocol is carried out as
            approved by the IRBi and in accordance with applicable Universityii and regulatory requirements. When
            research does not follow this plan, such occurrences can have a negative impact on research participants.
            Protocol deviations can alter the risk-benefit ratio for participants or may jeopardize in some way the
            safety, rights, and welfare of research participants, or the integrity and validity of the study design.</p>
        <p>However, there are certain times when it is necessary to implement a planned deviation from the approved
            research plan, or continue aspects of the research during a lapse in IRB approval, to protect research
            participants. Regardless of the reasons behind them, protocol deviations must be reported to the Research
            Integrity office for a compliance assessment. The goal is to have an open dialogue and work toward a
            mutually agreeable solution that is consistent with institutional and regulatory responsibilities.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <p>Protocol deviations associated with an IRB approved protocol must be reported to the Research Integrity
            office for a compliance assessment and, if necessary, review by the IRB.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Definitions</u>
        <p><strong>Protocol Deviation: </strong>Any exception or change to a research protocol that is not approved by the IRB prior to
            its initiation or implementation.</p>
        <p>A protocol deviation may be categorized as major or minor.</p>
        <p>A <strong>major deviation </strong>is one that: a) has increased the risk and/or decreased the benefit to
            individual participants, or resulted in detrimental change to a participant&rsquo;s clinical or emotional
            status, or compromised the integrity or validity of the study; b) has occurred without appropriate IRB
            review and approval; c) is egregious or intentional; and/or d) has been determined by the IRB to be a major
            deviation.</p>
        <p>A <strong>minor deviation </strong>is an unintentional deviation or omission from a protocol that does not
            impact research participant safety or does not substantially alter risks to research participants.</p>
        <p><strong>Continuing Non Compliance:</strong> A deviation is determined to be &ldquo;continuing&rdquo; if it involves repeated
            incidents which suggest that noncompliance will continue unless the IRB intervenes. For example, the IRB may
            determine that repeated minor deviations (continuing non-compliance) are equivalent in severity to a major
            deviation.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Accountability</u>
        <strong>The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Ensuring that his/her human subjects research protocol is carried out as approved by the IRB and in
                    accordance with applicable University and regulatory requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reporting protocol deviation(s) to the Assistant Director, RI or Assistant Vice President, Research
                    for any protocol for which he/she has responsibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Providing additional information as requested by the IRB to further investigate a report of a
                    protocol deviation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Developing a corrective action and preventive action plan (also referred to as a CAPA plan for FDA
                    regulated studies) for protocol deviations that may occur in an IRB approved protocol for which
                    he/she has responsibility.</p>
                
            </li>
            <strong>The IRB will be responsible for:</strong>
            <li>
                <p>Reviewing protocol deviation reports and determining if the event was a minor or major deviation and
                    if the pattern of these events is continuing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reviewing, recommending and approving corrective action plans for any reported protocol deviations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Suspending and terminating approval for an IRB approved protocol, if necessary, to protect the
                    welfare of the human subjects involved.</p>
                
            </li>
            <strong>The Research Integrity office will be responsible for:</strong>
            <li>
                <p>Receiving and assessing protocol deviation reports</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Communicating the IRB&rsquo;s determination and required corrective actions (if any) to the
                    investigator in writing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Following up with the investigator to ensure and document that the corrective action has been taken.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reporting major protocol deviations to the appropriate institutional officials, federal agencies
                    (e.g., the Office for Human Research Protection, Food and Drug Administration, etc.) or funding
                    agency, as appropriate.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Procedures</u>
        <p>Reports of protocol deviations may come to the IRB from various sources, including a research participant, a
            member of the research team, or through formal or informal monitoring or auditing. Regardless of the source,
            the reporting and review mechanisms are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If a protocol deviation has occurred, whether major or minor, it should be promptly communicated to
                    the Assistant Director, RI or Assistant Vice President, Research after the Principal Investigator
                    learns of the incident. The report can be made by e-mail or phone. Depending on the seriousness of
                    the deviation, the PI may be required to follow up by immediately submitting a formal report to the
                    IRB via IRBNET.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Research staff (co-investigators, RAs, etc.) who become aware of a protocol deviation should notify
                    the PI as soon as possible. If the member of the research staff prefers not to notify the PI, he/she
                    may contact the Assistant Director, RI or Assistant Vice President, Research or report according to
                    the University&rsquo;s whistleblower procedures: <a
                        href="http://www.fau.edu/policies/files/1.9%20Fraud.pdf"
                        target="_blank">http://www.fau.edu/policies/files/1.9%20Fraud.pdf</a> In cases where the report
                    comes from a source other than the PI, the IRB may later ask the PI to submit a formal protocol
                    deviation report.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If any changes are needed to the protocol or consent materials (e.g., to reflect permanent changes to
                    the protocol as a result of a deviation), these should be briefly described in the report. These
                    changes must also be submitted as a separate amendment request. The IRB may also require additional
                    or different changes as a result of their review.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When a report of protocol deviation is received, the IRB or Research Integrity staff may ask the PI
                    or other parties to provide additional information so the IRB can further investigate the deviation
                    and ensure the report is complete.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The IRB will respond to a protocol deviation report relative to its level of severity. When reviewing
                    protocol deviation reports, the IRB will determine if the event was a <em>minor </em>or <em>major
                    </em>deviation and if the pattern of these events is continuing.</p>
                <p>Potential actions may include but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Establishing a corrective action/preventive action plan.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Requiring investigator(s) to complete remedial training.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Requiring research participants to be re-consented.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Permitting or disallowing the use of data collected during the protocol deviation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Requiring more frequent IRB review of the project.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Limiting the investigator&rsquo;s human subjects research privileges.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>IRB staff will communicate the IRB&rsquo;s determination and required corrective actions (if any) to
                    the PI and any relevant parties in writing, and will follow up with the investigator to ensure and
                    document that the corrective action has been implemented.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Major protocol deviations will be reported to the appropriate institutional officials and the federal
                    agency (e.g., the Office for Human Research Protection, FDA, etc.) or funding agency, as
                    appropriate. Some protocol deviations may also be regarded as research misconduct according to
                    University policy, and further action may be required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The IRB has the authority to suspend or terminate approval of research that is not being conducted in
                    accordance with IRB policy and federal regulations or that deviates from the approved protocol. The
                    Committee also has the authority to halt any activity that meets the definition of &ldquo;human
                    subjects research&rdquo; even if the activity was not previously submitted for IRB review.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
