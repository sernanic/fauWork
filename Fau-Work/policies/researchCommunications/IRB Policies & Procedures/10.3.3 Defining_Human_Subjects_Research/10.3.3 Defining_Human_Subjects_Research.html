        <u>Background</u>
        <p>Human subjects research (HSR) is defined as a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to
            generalizable knowledge that involves obtaining information about living individuals through intervention or
            interaction. This definition is based on the Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) regulations [45
            CFR 46.102(d)(f)].</p>
        <p>Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers any clinical investigation involving a human
            subject to be human subjects research [21 CFR 50, 21 CFR 56, 21 CFR 312 and 21 CFR 812]</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Purpose</u>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to set forth the regulations which define human subjects research, and to
            codify Florida Atlantic University&rsquo;s position that any HSR conducted under its auspices, whether
            funded or not, must undergo appropriate ethical review.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>General Statement</u>
        <p>The IRB has jurisdiction over the ethical review of Human Subjects Research. Any research involving human
            subjects (as defined by HHS regulations or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulations,) that is
            conducted under the auspices of FAU, must be submitted to the FAU Institutional Review Board, or other
            appropriate IRB, for ethical review.</p>
        <p>When a FAU researcher seeks approval to analyze de-identified data or biospecimens of a vulnerable population
            collected by another institution, ethical guidelines should still be considered. Researchers should make an
            effort to ensure that appropriate ethical guidelines were followed when the data/biospecimen was collected.
            Specifically, the original data or sample collection should have been</p>
        <p>collected under board review (IRB or equivalent). The data should have been collected using active and
            informed consent and assent as applicable. Appropriate letters of authorization and collaboration should be
            available from the source of the dataset.</p>
    </li>
    <hr/>
    <li>
        <u>Policy</u>
        <p>Any research involving human subjects as defined by HHS regulations or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
            Regulations and is conducted under the auspices of FAU, must be submitted to the FAU Institutional Review
            Board, or other appropriate IRB, for ethical review.</p>

        <u>Definitions</u>
        <strong>DHHS Regulations</strong>
        <p>Human subjects research means the proposed study meets the definition of <u>both</u></p>
        <strong>human subjects and research as defined below:</strong>
        <p><strong>Research</strong>: Research is a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation,
            designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Activities meeting this definition constitute
            research, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for
            other purposes. [45 CFR 46.102(d)]</p>
        <p><strong>Human subject: </strong>a living individual <em>about whom </em>an investigator (whether professional
            or student) conducting research : (1) Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or
            interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or (2)
            Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or</p>
        <p>identifiable biospecimens.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Intervention:</strong> both physical procedures by which data or biospecimens are gathered (for example:
                    venipuncture) and manipulations of the participant or the participant's environment that are
                    performed for research purposes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Interaction</strong> includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and participant.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Private information:</strong> information about behavior occurring in a context in which an individual can
                    reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been
                    provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will
                    not be made public (for example, a medical record). [45 CFR 46.102(f)]</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical trial:</strong> a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to
                    one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of
                    the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.</p>
                <p>FDA Regulations</p>
                <strong>Human subjects research means the proposed study meets the definition of <u>both</u></strong>
                <strong>human subject and clinical investigation as defined below:</strong>
                <p><strong>Clinical Investigation: </strong>any experiment that involves a test article and one or more human subjects
                    and the results of which are intended to be submitted later to, or held for inspection by, the FDA
                    as part of an application for a research or marketing permit. [21 CFR 50.3(c), 21 CFR 56.102 (c)]
                    The term does not include nonclinical laboratory studies that are subject to the provisions of 21
                    CFR 58.</p>
                <p><strong>Human subject: </strong>an individual who is or becomes a participant in research, either as
                    a recipient of a <em>test article</em>* or as a control. A subject may be either a healthy
                    individual or a patient. [21 CFR 50.3(g)] <em>For research involving medical devices</em>, a human
                    subject means a human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom, or on
                    whose specimen an investigational device is used, or as a control. A subject may be in normal health
                    or may have a medical condition or disease. [21 CFR 812.3(p)]</p>
                <p>*<strong>Test article: </strong>any drug (including a biological product for human use), medical
                    device for human use, human food additive, color additive, electronic product, or any other article
                    subject to regulation under the act or under sections 351 or 354-360F of the Public Health Service
                    Act [21 CFR 50.3 (j)] [21 CFR 56.102 (1)]</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
