                            <p>
                                At FAU, the Diving Board operates with the additional scope of scientific
                                boating and is therefore called the diving and boating board. The board
                                must meet all prescriptive requirements for a diving control board
                                outlined by the AAUS, as specified herein.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Scientific diving programs fall under the scope of OSHA Regulations for
                                Commercial Diving Operations. However, OSHA grants an exemption for
                                scientific diving programs provided the following specific and
                                prescriptive conditions are met (Appendix B to 29CFR1910 Subpart T):

                                        The Diving Board consists of a majority of active scientific divers
                                        (including the Diving and Boating Safety Officer) and has autonomous
                                        and absolute authority over the scientific diving program&rsquo;s
                                        operation.

                                        The purpose of the project using scientific diving is the advancement
                                        of science; therefore, information and data resulting from the project
                                        are non-proprietary.

                                        The tasks of a scientific diver are those of an observer and data
                                        gatherer. Construction and trouble-shooting tasks traditionally
                                        associated with commercial diving are not included within scientific
                                        diving.

                                        Scientific divers, based on the nature of their activities, must use
                                        scientific expertise in studying the underwater environment and
                                        therefore, are scientists or scientists-in-training.

                                to the Vice President for Research (VPR). The VPR will review nominations
                                and make final appointments to the DBB. Terms of service on the DBB
                                (including the Chair) will be for staggered terms to ensure consistency of
                                board activities and procedures. Members may voluntarily terminate
                                membership on the DBB. Written notification of intent to resign shall be

                                changes of policy and procedure. Sub-boards shall meet as often as needed
                                or as directed by the DBB. The presence of at least a majority of the
                                voting members including the Chair (or Vice Chair) and the DBSO (or
                                alternate DBSO) at any meeting of the DBB or sub-board shall constitute a
                                quorum and shall be a duly constituted meeting for the purpose of
                                conducting business. All matters shall be decided by simple majority of
                                the members present and voting at such meeting, when quorum requirements
                                have been met. Voting decisions agreed upon by the majority of members
                                shall constitute an official decision or determination to be carried
                                forward or implemented as specified by the board. Members will forward
                                agenda items at least 10 working days ahead of the meeting. Meeting
                                agendas will be published at least 5 business days prior to the scheduled
                                meetings.

                                <strong><u>The DBB shall have the full authority and obligation to enforce
                                        compliance</u></strong> with all relevant diving and boating regulations and
                                ensure reasonable
                                standards of safety and health. The DBB shall designate the routine
                                operational authority for this program to the DBSO and advise on the
                                performance of such duties. The DBSO shall immediately cease any diving
                                and boating activity that represents a threat to people or the University
                                and bring the matter before the board for further investigation. For
                                situations of non-compliance that are brought to the attention of the
                                Board, the DBB (or designee) will provide a prompt report of the
                                circumstances to the VPR, EH&amp;S, and Research Integrity with a copy to
                                the PI, respective college dean and department chair. Within 3-5 business
                                days (or as soon as feasibly possible) following the halting of the
                                activity or project, the DBB will convene to assess the situation. The
                                DBSO will be charged to present the circumstances surrounding the incident
                                with a written report provided to the DBB, which will include a written
                                report from the PI. The DBB will consider all available facts and
                                evidence, make a determination regarding the incident and follow up with a
                                final, written report to all parties concerned including the VPR, College
                                and Provost&rsquo;s offices. If the DBB does determine that the event or
                                activity does constitute non-compliance, the PI will be required to
                                present a corrective action plan to address the non-compliance with a plan
                                that such an event or activity will not occur again in the future. The
                                DBSO will work with the PI, department chair and college dean on this
                                corrective action plan and the final plan will be submitted to the DBB for
                                review and final approval. Only once the corrective action plan has been
                                reviewed and approved by the DBB can the project or activity be resumed.
                                All communications associated with the non-compliance must be
                                appropriately documented.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the corrective action plan has been approved by the DBB the PI will
                                be given a timeline to implement the plan and follow up with the DBB. If
                                the PI does not follow the corrective action plan within the required
                                timeline, the DBB will notify the PI that he/she has thirty (30) days from
                                the date of the follow up notice to satisfactorily implement the
                                corrective action plan. Should this deadline not be adhered to, the DBB
                                will notify the FAU Vice President of Research, the Provost&rsquo;s
                                office, the College Dean and Department Chair for further action.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Should any faculty or staff believe that they have been or will be
                                adversely affected by action or inaction of the DBB, or have concerns
                                related to the diving and safety program at FAU, those persons will be
                                encouraged to openly discuss such instances with and resolve any
                                differences directly with the DBB. If a faculty or staff member objects to
                                a DBB recommendation concerning a violation of a DBB policy or procedure,
                                a written complaint must be filed with RI within 30 days of the
                                recommendation. The complaint shall state the nature of the objection(s)
                                including any adverse effects, specify the actions or inactions that are
                                at issue, and specify the remedial action(s) that would satisfy the
                                appellant&rsquo;s concerns. Previous efforts to resolve the objection(s)
                                and the outcome shall be noted in this document. Within thirty (30) days
                                after receipt of the complaint, the respondent (i.e., DBB) shall provide a
                                response, in writing, to the appellant. If the appellant and the
                                respondent are unable to resolve the written complaint informally, RI
                                shall schedule a meeting between the respondent, the appellant, the DBB
                                Chair, the DBSO, the Assistant Vice President for Research Integrity, the
                                Director of EH&amp;S, and the VPR to discuss and resolve the issue.

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
