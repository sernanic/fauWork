        The Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Diving and Boating Safety Committee (DBSC) is authorized by, and delegated
        authority by, the FAU Vice President for Research. The principal purpose of the DBSC is to promulgate and
        administer university policies and procedures with regard to the safety of all scientific diving and boating
        activities at FAU.<br/><br/>
        The DBSC wishes to share guidance regarding the training requirements for operation of motorized vessels.<br/><br/>
        Anyone seeking approval to operate a motorized vessel under the auspices of FAU must (1) successfully complete
        the Florida Safe Boater Course (or Florida-approved equivalent), (2) successfully complete the U.S. Department
        of the Interior Motorboat Operator Certification Course (MOCC) and (3) demonstrate operational proficiency in
        specific boats, based on the research to be conducted. The Florida Safe Boater Course is available free of
        charge from the following website: http://boatus.org/florida/. The MOCC is provided regularly by FAUâ€™s
        Environmental Health and Safety Department free of charge to FAU personnel. Additional training requirements for
        airboat operators are specified in the FAU Diving and Boating Safety Manual.
