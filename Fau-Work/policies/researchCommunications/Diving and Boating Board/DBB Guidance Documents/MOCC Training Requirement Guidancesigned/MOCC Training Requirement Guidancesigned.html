        The Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Diving and Boating Safety Committee (DBSC) is authorized by, and delegated
        authority by, the FAU Vice President for Research. The principal purpose of the DBSC is to promulgate and
        administer university policies and procedures with regard to the safety of all scientific diving and boating
        activities at FAU.<br/><br/>
        The DBSC wishes to share guidance regarding the training requirements for operation of motorized vessels.<br/><br/>
        Anyone seeking approval to operate a motorized vessel under the auspices of FAU who is not currently an
        FAU-approved boater must (1) successfully complete the U.S. Department of the Interior Motorboat Operator
        Certification Course (MOCC) and (2) demonstrate operation proficiency in specific boats as determined by the
        Diving and Boating Safety Officer (DBSO) or designee. Principal Investigators or others seeking to be considered
        a designee for determining proficiency should contact the DBSO. The MOCC is provided regularly by FAUâ€™s
        Environmental Health and Safety Department free of charge to FAU personnel. Additional training requirements for
        airboat operators are specified in the FAU Diving and Boating Safety Manual.
