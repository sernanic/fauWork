    <p>
        The Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Diving and Boating Safety Committee (DBSC) is authorized by, and delegated
        authority by, the FAU Vice President for Research. The principal purpose of the DBSC is to promulgate and
        administer university policies and procedures with regard to the safety of all scientific diving and boating
        activities at FAU.<br/><br/>
        The DBSC wishes to share guidance regarding the requirements for first aid and CPR training for FAU boat
        operators.<br/><br/>
        All FAU boat operators will be required to have a current American Red Cross or equivalent CPR and First Aid
        certification by 1 May 2019. Certifications must be renewed every two years. Training will be provided by FAUâ€™s
        Environmental Health and Safety Department free of charge. Prospective boat operators who take the Motorboat
        Operator Certification Course (MOCC) will receive CRP and First Aid training as part of that course.
