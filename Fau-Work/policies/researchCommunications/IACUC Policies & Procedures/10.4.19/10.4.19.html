                            <p>All Florida Atlantic University Animal Care and Use Protocols must be renewed every three
                                years by the Principal Investigator to ensure that the study remains in compliance, that
                                the activities have been conducted in accordance with the approved protocol, that
                                significant modifications receive prior IACUC approval, and to ensure that any new
                                requirements of PHS, USDA, and/or FAU are conveyed to the Principal Investigator.</p>

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>The purpose of this document is to describe the process for animal care and maintenance
                                in the event a Principal Investigator’s animal care and use protocol has expired or has
                                been suspended by the IACUC.</p>
                        </li>
                        <hr />
                        <li>
                            <h2>Policy</h2>
                            <p>
                                An animal care and use protocol expires at 12:01 a.m. three years after the approval
                                date
                                (for instance, a protocol approved on December 15, 2010 expires December 15, 2013 at
                                12:01 a.m.). If a previously IACUC approved animal activity, as described in an Animal
                                Care and Use protocol is allowed to expire, regardless of the circumstances, all
                                experimental animal activity conducted under that expired protocol must cease.
                                Continuation of experimental animal activities in the absence of a valid approved
                                protocol is a violation of PHS Policy, terms and conditions of PHS-funded grants, FAU
                                Policy and FAUAssuranceofCompliancewith PHSPolicy.This activity becomes an issue of
                                noncompliance.<br /><br />
                                Every three years the Principal Investigator must submit a new Protocol for Animal Care
                                and Use if the project is to be continued. If the study involves USDA covered animals,
                                annual IACUC review and approval is required of the protocol and the investigator is
                                responsible for submitting continuing review documentation to the IACUC.<br /><br />
                                If the IACUC Protocol approval expires, animals are transferred to the holding protocol
                                to be maintained by the Director of Comparative Medicine (CM) until such time that an
                                active, approved IACUC protocol is in place again to transfer the animals back to. In
                                this way, animals will always be cared for, but no experimental procedures are
                                permitted. During times of transfer to holding protocol, the per diem charges will
                                continue to be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator.

                            <strong>Maintenance of Animals Associated with Expired or Suspended Protocols</strong>
                            <p>The CM Director will maintain an Animal Holding Protocol (AHP) for animals on an expired
                                protocol that are housed at FAU.</p>
                            <i>If an expired/suspended protocol covers animals purchased and maintained by CM:</i>

                                <li>CM identifies active cage cards under the expired protocol, transfers those cages
                                    and animals to the AHP, and contacts the principal investigators.</li>
                                <li>The cages are tagged with an identifying mark so that all staff will recognize that
                                    these animals may not be used in any way, only maintained.</li>
                                <li>Maintenance may include the provision of special diets, medicines, and procedures
                                    necessary to maintain the animals in a condition suitable for further studies.
                                    However, no data collection in conjunction with the research described in the
                                    protocol may be done.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <i>If an expired/suspended protocol covers animals not purchased or maintained by CM (e.g.,

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
