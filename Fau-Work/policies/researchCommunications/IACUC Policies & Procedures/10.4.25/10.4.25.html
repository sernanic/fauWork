                            <p>The use of pharmaceutical-grade substances in laboratory animals ensures that the
                                substances administered meet established documentable standards of purity and
                                composition. This in turn helps ensure research animal health and welfare, as well as
                                the validity of experimental results. The use of lower grade substances/compounds with
                                undefined or higher levels of impurities or poorly formulated non-commercial
                                preparations can introduce unwanted experimental variables or even toxic effects, and so
                                should be avoided if at all possible.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>To comply with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) and United States
                                Department of Agriculture (USDA) regarding their Guidelines for the use of non-
                                pharmaceutical grade substances in laboratory animals.</p>
                        </li>
                        <hr />
                        <li>
                            <h2>General Statement</h2>
                            <p>Although pharmaceutical grade substances should be used in experimental animals whenever
                                possible, the use of non-pharmaceutical-grade substances in experimental animals is an
                                acceptable practice under certain circumstances. For example, in the case of new
                                investigational compounds, they would be the only grade and formulation available. The
                                NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) and the United States Department of
                                Agriculture (USDA) both have determined that the use of non-pharmaceutical-grade
                                substances should be based on (1) scientific necessity, (2) non-availability of an
                                acceptable veterinary or human pharmaceutical-grade compound, and (3) specific review
                                and approval by the IACUC. Cost savings alone is not considered an adequate
                                justification for the use of non-pharmaceutical-grade substances in laboratory animals.
                                OLAW has also stated that while the possible implications of the use of
                                non-pharmaceutical grade substances in non-survival studies appears less evident, the
                                scientific issues remain the same and professional judgment, as outlined above, must
                                still apply. It is important to understand that OLAW’s statement pertains to all
                                components, both active and inactive, contained in the preparation to be administered.
                                Therefore, the vehicle used to facilitate administration of a compound is as important
                                of a consideration as the active compound in the preparation.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h2>Policy</h2>
                            <p>For all compound use, the IACUC should consider the grade/purity being proposed, the
                                formulation of the final product, and issues such as sterility, pyrogenicity, stability,
                                pH, osmolality, site/route of administration, pharmacokinetics, physiological
                                compatibility, and quality control.</p>
                            <p>When selecting compounds the following order of choice should be applied:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>FDA approved veterinary or human pharmaceutical compounds;</li>
                                <li>FDA approved veterinary or human pharmaceutical compounds used to compound a needed
                                    dosage form;</li>
                                <li>USP/NF or BP pharmaceutical grade compound used in a needed dosage form;</li>
                                <li>Analytical grade bulk chemical used to compound a needed dosage form (requires
                                    justification);</li>
                                <li>Other grades and sources of compounds (requires justification).</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                NOTE: For new investigational drugs the grade and formulation is not optional, but the
                                investigator and IACUC can verify health and safety issues described above.<br /><br />
                                NOTE: When developing and reviewing a proposal to use non-pharmaceutical grade compounds
                                the investigator and IACUC should consider animal welfare and scientific issues related
                                to the use of the compounds, including potential for contamination, safety, efficacy,
                                and the inadvertent introduction of confounding research variables.<br /><br />
                                For all non-pharmaceutical grade substances used in animals, the IACUC shall consider
                                the grade/purity being proposed, the formulation of the final product, and issues such
                                as sterility, pyrogenicity, stability, pH, osmolality, site/route of administration,
                                pharmacokinetics, physiological compatibility, and quality control. The IACUC may use a
                                variety of administrative methods to review and approve the use of such agents. For
                                example, the IACUC may establish acceptable scientific criteria within the institution,
                                rather than on a case-by-case basis. The use of non-pharmaceutical-grade compounds in
                                laboratory animals shall be clearly delineated and justified in the protocol document
                                and/or covered by an IACUC policy developed for their use.<br /><br />
                                Examples for use of Non-Pharmaceutical-Grade Substances: It would be reasonable for the
                                IACUC to review and the Committee may approve the use of non-pharmaceutical- grade
                                substances in the following situations:
                            </p>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>If no equivalent veterinary or human drug is available for experimental use, then
                                    the highest-grade equivalent chemical reagent should be used and formulated
                                    aseptically and with a non-toxic vehicle as appropriate for the route of
                                    administration.</li>
                                <li>Although an equivalent veterinary or human drug is available for experimental use,
                                    the chemical-grade reagent is required to replicate methods from previous studies
                                    because results are directly compared to those of replicated studies.</li>
                                <li>Although an equivalent veterinary or human drug is available, dilution or change in
                                    formulation is required.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Dilution of a pharmaceutical grade substance with a non-pharmaceutical grade
                                            substance results in the original compound no longer being pharmaceutical
                                            grade. Therefore, if adulteration by dilution, addition or other change in
                                            formulation is required, there may be no additional advantage to be gained
                                            by using the USP formulation</li>
                                        <li>Use of the highest-grade reagent may have the advantage of single-stage
                                            formulation and also result in purity that is equal to or higher than the
                                            human or veterinary drug.</li>
                                        <li>Professional judgment should be used to determine the appropriate test
                                            material and to ensure use of an agent with the least likelihood for causing
                                            adverse effects.</li>
                                    </ul>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
