                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>Florida Atlantic University (FAU) currently has institution-wide animal care standards in
                                place to ensure that all activities involving animals are conducted in a humane and
                                ethical manner; that housing and care of animals is appropriate for the species; and
                                that all persons working with animals are safe and protected (see Division of Research
                                Policy 10.4.1A). While these standards are intended to cover all animals involved in
                                research, existing policies and guidelines primarily address animals bred exclusively
                                for research (i.e. “animal models”). Federal guidelines, including but not limited to
                                the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide) and the Animal Welfare
                                Act (AWA), support not only the humane care and use of animals bred for research, but
                                also animals used in research, teaching or testing activities which are free-living
                                within natural setting (i.e. “wildlife”).</p>

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>To establish a policy that will enhance existing institution-wide animal care standards
                                by providing improved guidance to Research Personnel and Animal Care Staff to
                                accommodate the unique and diverse aspects of wildlife research, while ensuring that the
                                health and welfare of the research animals and personnel are maintained.

                                <li>
                                    <p>The IACUC recognizes and acknowledges the following:</p>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>It is not always possible to predict at the initiation of field studies all
                                            potential observation or collection opportunities, the number of animals to
                                            be encountered, the species to be encountered, or the effects of research
                                            procedures.</li>
                                        <li>No concise or specific compendium of approved methods for field research
                                            encompassing all species, settings, and methods is available, practical, or
                                            even desirable.</li>
                                        <li>There is considerable variability among taxa of wild vertebrates in terms of
                                            their basic needs and how they should be handled, and that the PI is often
                                            the most qualified institutional authority on the biology of the species
                                            under study, and the techniques appropriate for the conduct of the proposed
                                            study.</li>
                                        <li>The number of specimens required for a field investigation will vary
                                            greatly, depending upon the questions being explored.</li>
                                        <li>Field studies often require larger samples than laboratory studies because,
                                            1) field studies have less control over biotic and abiotic conditions that
                                            produce variation, and 2) a number of specimens that is perceived to be
                                            large may represent only a small percentage of the actual wild population.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>State and federal wildlife agencies review applications for permits for
                                            their scientific merit and their potential impact on native populations, and
                                            issue permits that authorize the taking of specified numbers of individuals,
                                            the taxa and methods allowed, the period of study, and often other
                                            restrictions designed to minimize the likelihood that an investigation will
                                            have deleterious effects.</li>
                                        <li>Pain perception by many species of vertebrate animals may not be uniform
                                            over the various portions of their bodies, and that broad extrapolation of
                                            pain perception across taxonomic lines may not be appropriate.</li>
                                        <li>Field conditions will be variable and are often unpredictable</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Despite these acknowledgements, the FAU IACUC affirms that the respectful use
                                    of animals, which includes the consideration for the well-being of the animal as
                                    well as the avoidance/minimization of pain and distress of animals, including
                                    wildlife, remains an ethical and scientific necessity.

                                        <li>The PI should inform themselves and their research team of the permitting

                                    <p>The PI and associated research staff should be familiar with the animals to be
                                        studied and their response to disturbance, sensitivity to capture and restraint,
                                        and requirements for captive maintenance to the extent that these factors are
                                        known or applicable to the study. The PI and associated staff should have
                                        adequate experience, training, and knowledge regarding the housing, feeding, and
                                        care requirements of the animals to be studied, to the extent that these factors
                                        are known or applicable. If animals are to be held at field sites, the living
                                        conditions should be appropriate for the involved animals, and contribute to
                                        their health and well-being. In each of these instances it is ultimately the
                                        responsibility of the PI to direct these field activities.</p>

                                    <p>The objectives of many field studies mandate that individual animals be captured
                                        one or
                                        more times. In these instances, capture techniques that have minimal impact on
                                        the animal and which are environmentally benevolent should be used whenever
                                        possible. In addition, the potential for return to the natural environment
                                        should be incorporated into the sampling design whenever feasible.<br />
                                        Capture techniques that are generally considered to have more than a minimal
                                        impact, and which may therefore require additional scientific justification for
                                        use, include:</p>

                                        studies, which provides a way of determining the movements, abundance, and
                                        population dynamics of wild animals. PIs should carefully consider the nature
                                        and duration of restraint required by the marking technique, the amount of
                                        tissue affected, whether distress is momentary or prolonged, whether the animal
                                        after marking will be at greater than normal risk, whether the animal’s
                                        desirability as a mate is reduced, and whether the risk of infection or abscess
                                        formation is minimal. Acceptable marking techniques generally include:</p>

                                    <p>The PI should consider the potential for pain and discomfort associated with each
                                        of these techniques, and whether they should be preceded by a general or local

                                    <p>Methods used for sampling tissues or specimens from wild animals should be
                                        designed to obtain the maximal amount of scientific data, with the least amount
                                        of animal handling, restraint, and distress, involving a minimum number of
                                        animals. Methods that cause more than slight or momentary pain or discomfort
                                        require the use of appropriate anesthetics and/or analgesics. Aseptic sampling
                                        techniques and surgical procedures should be utilized. PIs should consider in
                                        consultation with a veterinarian whether antimicrobial drugs should be
                                        administered following sampling or surgical procedures. The applicant PI is

                                        in the field should consult with their physician to determine whether they
                                        should receive tetanus or other immunizations and have record of those

                                        survival and well-being of the animals such as natural light, ventilation,
                                        temperature, and humidity, unless these are factors under investigation.
                                        Adequacy of maintenance should be judged by monitoring factors such as
                                        appearance, activity level, general behavior, rate of growth, change in body
                                        weight, breeding success, and rate of survival. Nutritionally balanced diets
                                        should be provided, or natural foods should be duplicated as closely as

                                        the study requires the simulation of the natural setting. In instances where the
                                        study requires the simulation of the natural setting, the design of enclosures
                                        and methods of care should incorporate, as much as possible, those aspects of
                                        the natural habitat deemed important to the survival and well-being of the
                                        animals. PIs in collaboration with a veterinarian should consider whether newly
                                        captured animals that are brought into the laboratory should be quarantined from
                                        resident animals by a method appropriate to the taxon and the laboratory
                                        environment. Policies for relocating animals onto any FAU campus will be
                                        consistent with existing FAU policies regarding the housing of animals in either
                                        Comparative Medicine or PI managed facilities, including policies regarding the
                                        use of satellite facilities (http://www.fau.edu/research/docs/policies/research-

                                    <p>The collection of live animals and their preparation as museum specimens is
                                        necessary for research and teaching activities in systematic zoology. However,
                                        each animal collected should serve as a source of information on as many levels
                                        as practical (e.g., behavior, morphology, genetics, etc.) to assure the maximum
                                        utility of each animal, and to minimize instances of duplicate collecting.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Formalin fixation of dead specimens is acceptable, however
                                        euthanasia of un-anesthetized specimens by immersion in a formalin solution is
                                        unacceptable.</p>

                                        (42 CFR 71.54) which govern the importation and transfer of etiologic agents and

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
