                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>This document outlines the administrative structure of the FAU animal care and use
                                program. These administrative offices and leaders interact with and provide resources to
                                the many faculty, staff, and students who work with animals in their research, training,
                                and exhibition activities. However, the program goes beyond administrative structures
                                and procedures to comply with federal regulations. The humane care and
                                useofanimalsisasharedmissionandeverypersonat FAU(staff,faculty,or student) is expected
                                to understand, implement, and maintain best practices for promoting and protecting
                                animal welfare.</p>

                            <h2>Policy</h2>
                            <p>The FAU Animal Care and Use Program (ACUP) is a University-wide program with multiple
                                components, which is depicted in detail in Appendix 1, Organizational Chart.</p>
                            <strong>Required components of the Animal Care and Use Program:</strong>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    The Institutional Official. Federal regulations require that institutions appoint
                                    an Institutional Official (IO) who has ultimate authority and accountability for the
                                    animal care and use program, including allocating fiscal and non-fiscal resources to
                                    the program and ensuring compliance with the regulations. At FAU, the President has
                                    delegated that role to the Vice- President for Research. Although the overall
                                    direction of the ACUP is a shared responsibility among the IO, Attending
                                    Veterinarian (AV), and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), the IO
                                    is the person who is ultimately held responsible by federal authorities. For t h a t
                                    reason, the IO has the authority to withhold approval for any animal activity, even
                                    if it has been approved by the IACUC; however, the IO may not approve any activity
                                    where the IACUC has withheld approval.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Attending Veterinarian (AV). The AV is responsible for the health and well-being
                                    of all animals used in research, training, and exhibition at FAU. This includes
                                    oversight of the following: a) animal procurement and transportation; b)
                                    preventative medicine (including quarantine, biosecurity, and surveillance); c)
                                    treatment of clinical disease, disability, or related health issues; d) assessment
                                    and care of protocol-associated disease, disability, and related outcomes; e)
                                    surgery and perioperative care; f) assessment of pain and distress; g) anesthesia
                                    and analgesia; and h) euthanasia. The AV is an ex officio voting member of the IACUC
                                    and is involved in the design, planning and review of the animal care and use
                                    protocol. The AV also manages other aspects of animal care and use such as
                                    husbandry, housing of animals, and specialized training. In this capacity, she also
                                    serves as Director of Comparative Medicine Services at FAU.

                                <li>
                                    The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The IACUC is a faculty- led
                                    committee composed of scientists, non-scientists, veterinary professionals, and
                                    members of the community [community members have no affiliation with FAU]. The IACUC
                                    oversees and evaluates the animal care and use program by: a) reviewing all animal
                                    research, training, and exhibition projects, and making decisions to approve,
                                    withhold approval, require modifications, or suspend projects as appropriate; b)
                                    developing, reviewing and assessing all components of the animal program as well as
                                    inspecting and evaluating all animal facilities (including satellite facilities),
                                    laboratory space and study areas semi-annually and reporting these findings to the
                                    IO; c) reviewing and investigating legitimate concerns involving the care and use of
                                    animals at the institution and d) making recommendations to the IO regarding any
                                    aspect of the animal program, facilities or personnel training.

                                <strong>Additional Administrative Components of the Animal Care and Use
                                    Program:</strong>
                                <p>The FAU ACUP (or “Program”) includes all “activities conducted by and at an
                                    institution that have a direct impact on the well-being of animals, including animal
                                    and veterinary care, policies and procedures, personnel and program management and
                                    oversight, occupational health and safety, IACUC functions, and animal facility
                                    design and management.” The extensive volume of paperwork and processes required by
                                    Federal regulations cannot be handled solely by the IO, AV, and IACUC. To administer
                                    a diverse Animal Care and Use Program that spans four campuses, FAU relies on the
                                    support and collaboration of the following administrative units:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            Research Integrity (RI). RI, located in the Division of Research, is the
                                            primary administrative support office for all research compliance programs
                                            at FAU, including the animal care and use program. RI supports the IO,
                                            IACUC, faculty and students through a variety of functions including: a)
                                            advising faculty and students on the protocol submission process; b)
                                            processing all animal protocols and related actions; c) coordinating and
                                            scheduling all meetings and facility inspections; d) issuing all
                                            correspondence from the IACUC and IO to faculty and students; e) interacting
                                            with federal agencies (e.g., OLAW and UDSA) to discuss and report any
                                            compliance issues; f) investigatinganimalwelfareandnon-compliancecaseson

                                            other related actions. RI also coordinates all general training programs
                                            related to animal care and use, and works closely with the AV and CM staff
                                            who provide specialized training directed by the IACUC. RI facilitates
                                            communications between all components of the animal care and use program
                                            including the IO, AV, IACUC, and the FAU community.

                                            Comparative Medicine (CM). According to the Guide for the Care and Use of
                                            Animals, an institution must provide its AV with sufficient authority,
                                            including access to all animals and resources to manage the program of
                                            veterinary care. FAU’s Office of Comparative Medicine, also located in the

                                            staff support the Director of Comparative Medicine by routinely observing
                                            animals for signs of pain or distress, assisting in veterinary medical care,
                                            providing husbandry to animals (feeding, breeding, enrichment programs,
                                            etc.), and maintaining housing and facilities for all vertebrate animals on
                                            FAU campuses. At the direction of the IACUC, CM also provides
                                            “protocol-specific” training to personnel working with animals (see IACUC
                                            policy “10.4.22, Researcher Training”).

                                            Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) & Facilities Management. EH&S is the
                                            primary contact at FAU for matters of health, safety and the environment.
                                            EH&S supports the FAU ACUP by managing the occupational health and safety
                                            program known as the Medical Monitoring Program for Animals Users (MMPAU).
                                            Through the MMPAU, faculty and students working with animals receive initial
                                            assessment and risk evaluation, referral to appropriate vaccinations and
                                            medical care, and ongoing monitoring of their health status. EH&S also
                                            manages efforts to minimize biological, chemical and radioactive hazards
                                            associated with animal activities.<br /><br />
                                            Facilities Management oversees services such as construction, building
                                            maintenance, and physical plant operations. Facilities Management
                                            coordinates with the IO, AV, and IACUC to ensure any facility and physical
                                            plant issues (utilities, construction, noise control, etc.) do not adversely
                                            affect the well-being of animals at FAU. Both EH&S and Facilities Management
                                            report to FAU’s Vice-President for Administrative Affairs.<br/><br/>
                                            Collectively, FAU’s IO, AV, IACUC in conjunction with the administrative
                                            offices noted above, work together to promote animal welfare at FAU.

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
