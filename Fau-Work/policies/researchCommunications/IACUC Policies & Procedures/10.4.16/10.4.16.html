                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals states that preventative measures
                                should be considered such as physical and information technology security to protect
                                personnel from criminal activities, e.g. personnel harassment and assault, facility
                                trespassing and vandalism. “The scope of the security system should depend on the size
                                of the facility as well as the nature of the activities conducted within” (Guide).
                                Security and access control is not only important as a preventative tool for domestic
                                terrorism but also protects animal colonies vulnerable to infections with adventitious
                                agents. Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE) is per Guide one of the first
                                considerations of managing risks in the realm of personnel protection when working with
                                animals in research and teaching besides engineering controls, i.e. design of facilities
                                and safety equipment, and administrative controls, i.e. standard operating procedures.
                                It, again, also adds to the protection of animal resources from unwanted infections.</p>

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish animal facility access rules and minimum
                                requirements for wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling animals used
                                in research and teaching.</p>

                            <h2>General Statement</h2>
                            <p>FAU and its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee are committed to providing safe
                                animal facilities where faculty, staff, students, property and animals are free from
                                threats, assaults, and acts of violence. Working with animals exposes animal care
                                personnel, research personnel, students and potentially anybody entering animal
                                facilities to unique risks including allergies, injury from bites and scratches and
                                contracting diseases from the animals. Furthermore, sophisticated health surveillance
                                and quarantine programs including access control and required PPE to be worn have been
                                implemented to protect FAU animal colonies from adventitious infections keeping them in
                                an agreed upon specific- pathogen-free status.</p>

                                    – are required to maintain controlled access. Animals must be maintained behind at
                                    least one locked barrier/door, separated from public areas—facility doors must be
                                    equipped with locks or electronic security devices. Security features such as
                                    card-key systems or electronic surveillance should be considered.</li>

                                    the Research Integrity office or staff of other FAU departments with legitimate

                                    into an animal facility.</li>
                                <li>All others, including students, visitors and contractors must be escorted by
                                    authorized personnel and cleared by the AV or her designee if entering CM managed
                                    facilities. Faculty hosting visitors must complete the form “Visitors (Including

                                <li>No person under the age of 18 will normally be allowed in an animal facility.
                                    Persons under 18 years of age must adhere to and follow FAU Policy “Children in the

                                <li>Access control for research personnel will be established by the IACUC based on

                                <li>Under no circumstances should research personnel enter animal housing rooms that do
                                    not house their animals. Each person entering animal facilities has to be familiar
                                    with the health status levels within one vivarium and between different animal
                                    facilities and follow the instructions and signs posted.</li>
                                <li>Eating, drinking, chewing gum, applying cosmetics, and storing food for human use
                                    are prohibited within animal facilities except within designated break rooms.</li>
                                <li>Sandals and open toed shoes are prohibited in any animal facility. Personnel should

                                <li>Gloves should be worn whenever handling animals, dirty caging or equipment that was
                                    in contact with animals. Upon exit of a facility, hands should be washed or a hand

                                    within the particular vivarium or room. In PI managed facilities respective PIs or
                                    their departments are responsible for providing staff and students with appropriate

                                <li><strong>Animal Facility</strong> is an IACUC designated place where animals are
                                    housed under an
                                    approved IACUC protocol, either a CM managed centralized vivarium often also
                                    including procedure space or a PI managed satellite facility.</li>
                                <li><strong>Access to animal facilities</strong> can be unescorted or escorted.
                                    Unescorted access is the
                                    privilege of entering an animal facility at any time facilitated by key or slide
                                    card access provided to a particular person. Escorted access is the privilege of
                                    entering an animal facility while supervised/guided by a trained and qualified
                                    person with unescorted access privileges.</li>
                                <li><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</strong> refers to protective clothing
                                    including hair covers, eye/face protection and gloves worn by faculty, staff and
                                    students for protection against health and safety hazards. In addition, it also
                                    protects against cross contamination between animal colonies.</li>

Any experimental procedures including breeding and observation of animals housed in differing health status levels have to be

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
