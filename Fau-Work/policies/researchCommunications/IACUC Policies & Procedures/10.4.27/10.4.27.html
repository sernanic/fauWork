                            <p>There are scientific advantages for the use of photographs or videos of animals for
                                research, teaching or testing purposes. However, with the prevalent use of social media
                                and access to mobile devices with cameras and video recorders photographs or videos may
                                be used out of context by groups opposed to research involving animals in an effort to
                                misrepresent humane and ethical animal use as inappropriate.</p>

                <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
                Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
                every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
                transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
                University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
                new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
                public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
                Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
                more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
                in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
                more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
                engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
