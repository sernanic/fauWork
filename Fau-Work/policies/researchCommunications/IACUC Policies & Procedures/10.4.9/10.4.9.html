                        <p>Federal and state requirements including the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
                            pertaining to the use of hazardous materials in research require that Florida Atlantic
                            University’s IACUC review the use of hazardous materials proposed in research, teaching or
                            testing endeavors using vertebrate animals.</p>

                        <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        <p>Hazardous materials are strictly controlled by federal, state and local regulations.
                            Institutions have specific committees concerned with all instances of hazardous material
                            use. Florida Atlantic University has established specific safety committees composed of
                            professional staff and faculty with expertise in handling chemical, biological and
                            radiological agents. These committees include the Institutional Biosafety Committee and the
                            Radiation Safety Committee. The purpose of this policy is to ensure the appropriate safety
                            committee review and assess potential hazards proposed in research using animals.</p>

                        <h2>General Statement</h2>
                        <p>This policy is applicable to all research involving the use of hazardous materials in animals
                            conducted under the auspices of Florida Atlantic University (FAU)’s animal care and use
                            program and applies to field studies as well as all campus locations.

                        <h2>Policy</h2>
                        <p>Many research studies with vertebrate animals require the use of drugs, chemicals,
                            radioisotopes, biological agents, toxins and/or other substances that pose potential threats
                            to animals and/or human health. All substances that will be used in animals or animal
                            facilities must be described within the animal care and use protocol form. As each protocol
                            is reviewed, hazards are identified and, when necessary, additional safe practices are put
                            in place. Hazard review is typically conducted by Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) and
                            may include veterinarians, IACUC members, the Radiation Safety Committee and the
                            Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). If required, approval must be obtained from all
                            relevant departments and/or committees prior to starting any hazardous work with animals.
                            Changes in hazard use must be approved by the IACUC and relevant oversight bodies prior to
                            implementation.</p>

        <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
        Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
        every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
        transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
        University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
        new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
        public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
        Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
        more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
        in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
        more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
        engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
