                                consistent with sound scientific practices, is imperative&rdquo;. Both the <em>Animal
                                    Welfare Act </em>(AWA) and the <em>Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care
                                    and Use of Laboratory Animals </em>mandates the Institutional Animal Care and Use
                                Committee to review and approve any animal research protocols before an animal study can
                                be conducted. This includes determining whether pain/distress is involved and if so that
                                alternatives are considered, described provision for alleviation of pain/distress is
                                appropriate or if this would confound the research strong scientific justification is
                                provided. In addition, the IACUC is also obligated to monitor the studies after approval
                                including the implementation of the safeguards for minimization of pain/distress. The
                                Attending Veterinarian has to be consulted during the design of a study whenever
                                experimental procedures have the potential or real propensity to induce discomfort, pain
                                and/or distress (AWA &sect;2.33, b, 4).</p>

                            <p>A key aspect of the animal welfare regulations is that pain and distress in laboratory
                                animals be prevented or minimized whenever possible. The safeguarding of the well-being
                                of the animals is the legal and moral obligation of everybody involved in animal use and
                                care including IACUC members, veterinary and animal care staff as well as research
                                personnel. <strong>Prevention and lessening of pain/distress is likewise imperative

                                uncontrolled experimental variables with significant effects on research results since
                                it has been demonstrated that pain and stressors result in production of cytokines and
                                activation of an endocrine state of catabolism often translating into immunosuppression
                                and development of chronic pain states.</h2>
                            <p>Many laboratory animal species will hide their pain or distress and it is often difficult
                                to recognize it early enough. Therefore, it is generally accepted and expressed in
                                animal welfare regulations to assume that any procedures that would cause pain or
                                distress in humans will cause the same in other animal species as well unless evidence
                                to the contrary has been established.</p>

                                    <p> <strong>Pain</strong> is defined for non-human animals as &ldquo;an aversive sensory experience
                                        caused by actual or potential injury that elicits protective motor and
                                        vegetative reactions, results in learned avoidance and may modify

                                        Nociception is a measurable physiological event of a type usually associated
                                        with pain. A sensation of pain can exist in the absence of nociception.</p>

                                        pain, anxiety and sorrow. For animals distress includes conditions that are
                                        disagreeable, and which the animal would choose to avoid if possible.</p>

                                        the experimental objectives. Humane endpoints are chosen to minimize or

                                                alleviated with the measures described and approved in the IACUC
                                                protocol.</p>

                                            <p>Reducing post-procedural/post-operative pain/distress is accomplished by
                                                good nursing (i.e. supportive) care (e.g. keeping animal warm, clean,
                                                well padded, in a quiet environment with con-specifics if possible) and
                                                administration of analgesic drugs. It is best to provide preemptive
                                                (i.e. before the painful insult) analgesics to avoid
                                                &ldquo;wind-up&rdquo; pain that is often difficult to control and
                                                monitoring for pain should continue during and beyond the approved
                                                analgesic regimen. Supplementary analgesics need to be provided to
                                                individual animals on an as needed basis. In addition, it is important
                                                to prevent and/or treat post-anesthetic complications such as aspiration
                                                pneumonia, dehydration, infection. Note that any drug administered to
                                                animals, especially anesthetics, analgesics, and euthanasia agents
                                                cannot be expired at the time of administration.</p>

                                            <p>If death as an endpoint has been approved by the IACUC, the research
                                                personnel is responsible for monitoring the animal(s) at minimum twice
                                                daily when the moribund state has been reached (in the early morning and
                                                late afternoon) including weekend and holidays. Moribund animals must be
                                                provided easy access to food and water. Written records must be made of
                                                all monitoring events indicating date/time of observation, any findings
                                                (such as number of moribund animals and animals found dead) and initial
                                                of the person performing the monitoring. These records have to be easily
                                                available to the IACUC and CM personnel upon request.</p>

                                            <p>The assignment of pain categories has to be reviewed at appropriate
                                                intervals and changes may be recommended after additional observation.
                                                Amendments to protocol should be made either if the pain category is
                                                suggested to be reduced or increased.</p>

                                                Records should be kept within the animal facility. The entries should

                                                wheat measures are instituted, and when the adverse outcome is resolved
                                                or the animal euthanized.</p>

        <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
        Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
        every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
        transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
        University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
        new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
        public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
        Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
        more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
        in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
        more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
        engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
