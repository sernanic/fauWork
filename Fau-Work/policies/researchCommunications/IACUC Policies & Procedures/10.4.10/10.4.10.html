                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>Transporting animals can be stressful and can increase the potential for disease transmission
                            or injury. The Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals states that transportation
                            “should be planned to minimize transit time and the risk of zoonosis, protect against
                            environmental extremes, avoid overcrowding, provide food and water when indicated, and
                            protect against physical trauma.” The AWAR (§2.38, f) addresses the transit of animals as
                            part of adequate “handling”, which implies that the IACUC must consider transportation of
                            animals. Furthermore, the PHS Policy includes vehicles for transports of animals in its
                            definition of an animal facility.</p>

                        <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        <p>To establish a policy that will provide guidance to Research Personnel and Animal Care Staff
                            in regards to transport of animals, in order to support high standards for quality of
                            research, animal health and welfare.</p>

                        <h2>General Statement</h2>
                        <p>Animals will be transported in a manner that prevents injury, discourages observation by the
                            public, and protects the environment of the animal holding system.

                        <ol type="A">
                            <li><strong>Transport</strong> is the transfer of animals between rooms in the same
                                facility,between
                                buildings on the same campus, between buildings of different campuses, between
                                different natural field settings, a commercial wildlife animal supplier and the
                                experimental site, or between natural field settings and campus buildings. Buildings
                                can house vivaria or research laboratories approved to be used with live
                                animals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biosecurity</strong> encompasses all measures developed and implemented to
                                detect, prevent, contain, and eradicate adventitious infections. To exclude those
                                infections, research animals are maintained behind sanitized and disinfected room- to
                                cage-level barriers provided with filtered air and sanitized supplies and equipment as
                                appropriate
                                for the species protected.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conventional Animal Housing Area,</strong> for the sake of this policy,is
                                defined as any
                                animal facility/room/cubicle where animals can leave and return. Although many of the
                                management practices including security access are shared with the ones of the modified
                                barrier housing area the biosecurity level is lower meaning that the risk of introducing
                                an excluded microbial agent is higher.</li>
                            <li><strong>Modified Barrier Housing Area,</strong> for the sake of this policy,is defined
                                as any animal facility/room/cubicle where animals can only leave the facility for
                                terminal procedures and never be returned to this area. This provides higher biosecurity
                                and therefore lower risk for introducing any excluded microbial agent.</li>

                                    provide different levels of control over infectious disease exclusion, stressors
                                    unrelated to research activities, and research project security.</p>

                                    only leave the modified barrier for terminal procedures, or if experimental
                                    procedures cannot be accomplished in the modified barrier facility. Animals that
                                    exit barrier facilities for any reason may not return to barrier facilities/rooms
                                    thereafter. Exceptions for special experimental requirements may be granted, however
                                    specific justification must be approved by the IACUC and the Director, (CM) and

                                <p>Transport involving CM managed facilities are approved by the Director, CM based on

                                    Director, CM will work with the research team to accomplish the goals of the study

        <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
        Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
        every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
        transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
        University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
        new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
        public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
        Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
        more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
        in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
        more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
        engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
