                                Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th ed. (2011), (b) Guidelines for the
                                Care and Use of Mammals in Neuroscience and Behavioral Research, National Academy of

                            <p>Florida Atlantic University&rsquo;s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
                                has adopted the following policy to clarify the scenarios and procedures of regulating
                                food and/or fluid in rodents. Food and/or fluid regulation is typically used in the
                                research setting in (1) studies that use food/fluid consumption to motivate animals to
                                perform novel or learned tasks, (2) studies of the motivated behaviors and physiologic
                                mediators of hunger and thirst, and (3) homeostatic regulation of energy metabolism or
                                food balance. This guideline will outline important issues to be considered during
                                performance of these studies and addressed in protocols that require food and/or fluid
                                regulation/scheduling.</p>

                            <p>All studies proposing to use food or fluid modifications in animals as part of their
                                research must adhere to the procedures described in this policy in order to promote the
                                ethical use of animals in research, teaching or testing.</p>

                                        following must always be considered and adequately described in the IACUC

                                        excessive negative behavioral and physical consequences (e.g. increased

                                        to be taken into account when creating a food restriction plan. The absolute
                                        food amount provided must be adjusted accordingly over the duration of

                                        alleviated. Single housing and feeding during the light cycle might aggravate
                                        intolerance of food restriction.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Acute water restriction up to 24 hours will result in clinical dehydration, but
                                        restriction in excess of 24 hours is not permitted. Once an animal has learned a
                                        behavior, the daily amount of fluid provided should be increased to the maximum
                                        level that will ensure appropriate performance of task</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Animals should be provided sufficient time to acclimate to food or water
                                        regulation/scheduling, at a minimum 3 days, sometimes several weeks, to mitigate
                                        stress response unless specifically approved by the IACUC. Consideration should
                                        be made to allow food and water to be available concurrently, as rodents
                                        typically do not eat without available water. For animals undergoing
                                        regulation/scheduling, access to food and/or water must be for 15 minutes at a
                                        minimum. Regulated levels of food should not be lower than 30% of ad libitum
                                        values.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
