                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals states that single housing of social
                                species should be the exception, not the standard for housing. Furthermore, the Guide
                                specifies that environmental enrichment programs should be regularly reviewed by the
                                IACUC, researchers and veterinarian to ensure its benefit to animal well-being and
                                consistency with the goals of the research or teaching with animals. The AWR (9 CFR,
                                Chapter I) addresses social housing and environmental enrichment as well, stating that
                                primary enclosures must be enriched by providing means of expressing non-injurious
                                species-typical activities.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>Florida Atlantic University&rsquo;s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
                                has adopted the following policy to clarify the procedures for social housing and the
                                provision of environmental enrichment for all vertebrate animals housed as part of
                                research, teaching or testing activities at FAU.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h2>General Statement</h2>
                            <p>The primary aim of environmental enrichment is to enhance animal well-being by providing
                                animals with sensory and motor stimulation, through structures and resources that
                                facilitate the expression of species-specific behaviors and promote psychological
                                well-being through physical exercise, manipulative activities and cognitive challenges
                                according to species specific characteristics. Environmental enrichment can provide
                                animals with choices allowing some degree of control over their environment which leads
                                to better coping mechanisms with stressors. Pair or group housing is one of the best
                                enrichments for social species.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
