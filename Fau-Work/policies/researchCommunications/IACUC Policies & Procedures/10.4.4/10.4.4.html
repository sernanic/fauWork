                                The Animal Welfare Act and accompanying Regulations (9 Code of Federal Regulations)
                                provide detailed specifications for the humane handling, care, treatment, and
                                transportation of regulated animals used in research and teaching. Similarly, the Guide
                                for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Guide) states that proper housing and
                                management of animal facilities (including satellite facilities) are essential to animal
                                well-being, to the quality of research data, and teaching or testing programs in which
                                animals are used, and to the health and safety of personnel. In addition, the U.S.
                                Government Principles (Principle VII) require that the living conditions of animals
                                should be appropriate for their species and

                                To ensure that Satellite Animal Housing Facilities are created and used only when
                                scientifically or otherwise justified and that such facilities meet regulatory standards
                                and guidelines. <u>This applies to Comparative Medicine (CM)-managed and
                                    Investigator-managed facilities.</u>

                                Appropriate animal housing and management essentially influence animal well- being, the
                                quality of animal research, teaching or testing as well as the health and safety of
                                personnel. The Guide states that an appropriate animal care and use program “provides
                                environments, housing, and management that are well suited for the species or strains of
                                animals maintained and takes into account their physical, physiologic,andbehavioral
                                needs,allowingthemtogrow,mature,and reproduce normally while providing for their health
                                and well-being”. A Satellite Animal Housing Facility must comply with the same
                                regulations as Centralized Facilities.

                                        application. All Satellite Animal Housing Facilities used to house warm blooded
                                        vertebrates regulated by the USDA must be managed by the CM. A two-step process

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
