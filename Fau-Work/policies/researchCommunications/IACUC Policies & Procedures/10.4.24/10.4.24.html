                                    Atlantic University (FAU) currently has institution-wide animal care standards in
                                    place to ensure that all activities involving animals are conducted in a humane and
                                    ethical manner; that housing and care of animals is appropriate for the species; and
                                    that all persons working with animals are safe and protected (</a>Institutional
                                Policy 10.4.1a). While these standards are intended to cover all animals involved in
                                research, it is sometimes difficult to identify best practices in the application of
                                these standards to fish used in research, due to the variety of species involved, the
                                different types of research conducted, and the unique aspects of fish care and handling.

                            <p>To establish a policy that will enhance existing institution-wide animal care standards
                                by providing improved guidance to Research Personnel and Animal Care Staff to

                            <h2>Scope</h2>
                            <p>This policy applies to all fish included on an approved FAU IACUC protocol that are
                                housed in a Comparative Medicine (CM) or PI managed satellite facility, or in an
                                approved non-FAU facility. Fish uses covered by this policy include, but are not
                                necessarily limited to, research involving fish as experimental models, aquaculture
                                studies, wild caught fish once they are brought into a housing facility, and fish used
                                for teaching or testing.</p>
                            <p>Consistent with the Public Health Service&rsquo;s (PHS) definition, and for purposes of
                                this policy, the term &ldquo;fish&rdquo; includes all stages of development
                                post-hatching. However,</p>
                            <p>since many species do not to feel pain or distress during very early life stages, their
                                numbers may be separated from later stages, and the number can be listed as Column C in
                                the Pain Category column. The pain and distress categorization of later life stages
                                should be determined by the investigator based on the specific procedures described in
                                the protocol. However, procedures performed on fish of any age need to be described in
                                the IACUC protocol independent of pain category.</p>

                                        in terms of their basic needs and how they should be housed and handled, and the
                                        PI is often the most qualified institutional authority on the biology of the
                                        species under study, and the techniques appropriate for the conduct of the

                                        water, or their restraint under conditions that may cause physiological stress
                                        should be avoided or minimized. Changing environmental conditions under which
                                        fish are held, especially water temperature, should be performed gradually.
                                        Utilization of general or local anesthetics may be recommended in cases where
                                        prolonged restraint or invasive procedures are a necessary part of the research
                                        protocol.</p>

                                        stages, therefore their numbers may be separated from later stages, and the
                                        number can be listed as Column C in the Pain Category column. The pain and

                                            and </a>The Guide. The Guide states that, &ldquo;if paralyzing agents are to
                                        be used, the appropriate amount of anesthetic should first be defined on the
                                        basis of results of a similar procedure using the anesthetic without a blocking
                                        agent (NRC 2003, 2008, 2009a).&rdquo; The level of anesthesia should be
                                        sufficient to induce unconsciousness and analgesia corresponding with the
                                        painful stimulus, and should be monitored before, during, and after paralysis.
                                        Methods should include the monitoring of autonomic nervous system changes (e.g.
                                        heart rate), since paralysis eliminates many signs and reflexes that might
                                        otherwise be used to measure anesthetic depth.</p>
                                    <p>Tonic immobility may be used as a form of anesthesia in some scenarios, however
                                        use of this technique should be limited to immobilization for non- invasive
                                        procedures in captive research settings. If tonic immobility is used, adequate
                                        gill irrigation should be maintained to ensure adequate respiration and to
                                        prevent metabolic acidosis, and all efforts should be made to minimize the
                                        procedure time necessitating this technique.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
