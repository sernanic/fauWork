                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>Biomedical and wildlife research and teaching programs often require controlled
                                substances for prevention of pain and/or distress. Those substances are not only used
                                for anesthesia, analgesia, sedation or tranquilization but also for euthanasia and
                                sometimes as a means to study the actions of specific drug regimen. Controlled
                                substances have the potential for misuse, which is the reason for the requirement to
                                obtain a DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) license. University principles and procedures
                                regarding procurement, distribution, use, security, and recordkeeping of controlled
                                substances enforced by the DEA and other veterinary prescription drugs are guided by the
                                regulations detailed in 21 CFR 1300 and Florida Regulations (i.e. Chapters 474, 499, and
                                893 Florida Statutes and Rule Chapter 61N, Florida Administrative Code).</p>

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>To establish roles, responsibilities and requirements for conducting animal and
                                non-animal research involving controlled substances and other veterinary prescription
                                drugs at Florida Atlantic University. To abide by the guidance describing licensing,
                                storage, distribution, use, and disposal of controlled substances set forth by the
                                federal agency DEA and chapter 893, Florida Statutes as well as of other veterinary
                                prescription and human-label drugs that are governed by federal and state regulations.

                            <p>FAU researchers, employees, faculty, students or staff who use controlled substances in
                                animal based research, testing and teaching including non-vertebrate species and cell
                                cultures shall comply with all federal regulations, state rules, and institutional
                                requirements. All schedule II to V controlled substances and prescription drugs must be
                                procured through Comparative Medicine. When used in live animals, controlled substances
                                and prescription drugs must be of pharmaceutical (USP) grade unless otherwise specified
                                in the IACUC protocol and/or specific MOUs. Schedule I controlled substances are the
                                responsibility of the particular PI who uses it in his/her research and will have to
                                secure his/her own schedule I license.</p>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
