                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>The Public Health Service (PHS) policy and the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
                                Animals” (Guide) require the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the
                                Attending Veterinarian to provide oversight of all experimental procedures and guarantee
                                the welfare of the animals used in biomedical research. As stated in the NIH Guidelines
                                for the Genotyping of Mice and Rats, specific genetic identification of pups in a litter
                                is critical to the efficient pursuit of research and reducing the number of animals
                                involved in a research project. Likewise, this applies to the individual identification
                                of rodents depending on the particular study design. The Guide emphasizes that accurate
                                recording, with standardized nomenclature, of both the strain and substrain or of the
                                genetic background of research animals is essential.</p>

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines to researchers and animal care
                                staff regarding acceptable methods of tissue collection for the purpose of rodent
                                genotyping, individual identification of mice and rats as well as the proper
                                nomenclature of genetically modified animals (GMA).</p>

                            <h2>General Statement</h2>
                            <p>Properly executed procedures will protect the welfare of animals used, avoid exposing the
                                animals to undue stress and pain and provide physiologically stable biologic models for
                                research. The immense variety of mouse and rat strains including genetically modified
                                animals requires adequate nomenclature to ensure the name reflects the most relevant
                                information of the strain/substrain, which can carry spontaneous or induced mutations,
                                transgenes or knock-out/knock-in alleles existing in numerous different genetic
                                backgrounds.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h2>Policy</h2>
                            <ol type="A">
                                <li>Genomic DNA is requiredto genotype any genetically modified animal.The amount of
                                    DNA needed is dependent upon the analysis method employed. Polymerase Chain Reaction
                                    (PCR) and Southern Blot are two commonly used testing methodologies. Flow cytometry
                                    can also be used as a method of genotyping for certain specific applications.</li>
                                <li>For PCR analysis the least invasive methods of DNA collection include the use of
                                    small tissue samples from ear punching/notching, buccal/rectal swabs, hair samples,
                                    and blood. Based on the requirements of the study, researchers are urged to consider
                                    these noninvasive tissue collection sites.</li>
                                <li>Tail biopsies,suitable for Southern Blot and PCR and often used in mice and rats,
                                    involve removing a piece of tissue from the terminal end of the tail and should only
                                    be used after alternatives have been considered. The tail contains a variety of
                                    tissues, including bone, cartilage, blood vessels and nervous tissue.</li>
                                <li>The ideal time to collect tail tissue is in between post-natal days 10 and 15. At
                                    this age, the tail tip is soft, bones have not completely mineralized and the yield
                                    of DNA is highest. In addition, prompt analysis of tissue allows the desired mice
                                    and rats to be identified prior to weaning.</li>
                                <li>Biopsy of the tail tip can be performed without anesthesia on animals less than or
                                    21 days of age but requires anesthesia if animals are older than 21 days. Brief
                                    general anesthesia with isoflurane (either via vaporizer or open drop method in a
                                    fume hood) is recommended.</li>
                                <li>The total amount of tissue removed should be the minimum necessary. For tail tissue
                                    this would be ideally 2mm of the tip (usually sufficient for PCR) but not more than
                                    5mm to avoid developing coccygeal bones.</li>
                                <li>Repeated tail biopsies on a single animal are discouraged, requires general
                                    anesthesia and must be justified in the IACUC protocol. The use of post-procedural
                                    analgesia should be considered.</li>
                                <li>Cage cards are used for the identification of all animals following the
                                    recommendation of the Guide. However, for many studies it is advantageous to
                                    identify experimental animals individually. Temporary marking systems can be
                                    satisfactory for short time periods while permanent identification systems will not
                                    wear off rapidly and are more reliable.</li>
                                <li><strong>Temporary marking systems </strong>acceptable for rodents include fur
                                    clipping and shaving in distinct configurations on the animal’s body, non-toxic
                                    waterproof dyes and non-toxic colored markers applied in a variety of patterns on
                                    light-colored fur or hairless areas on the tail.</li>
                                <li><strong>Permanent identification systems </strong>considered acceptable for mice and
                                    rats include ear punch/notch, ear tags, microchip transponder and tattoos. Neonates
                                    can be identified via digit marking (tattoo) using non-toxic ink injections and toe
                                    clipping.</li>
                                <li><strong>Toe clipping </strong>may be approved by the IACUC after all other
                                    alternatives have been considered and a sound justification must be provided,
                                    especially if toe clipping serves a dual purpose of identification and tissue
                                    collection for genotyping. Toe clipping must only be used in altricial pre-weanling
                                    rodents up to 7 days of age in rats and up to 17 days in mice. Only the most distal
                                    bone of the toe (3rd phalanx) and only one toe per paw can be removed.</li>

                                <li>Research faculty and staff performing tissue collection procedures for genotyping
                                    and permanent identification methods must be trained and proficient in the
                                    procedures.</li>
                                <li>The Mouse Genome Informatics Database and the Rat Genome Database are the
                                    authoritative source of official names for genes, and alleles as well as strains of
                                    mice and rats, respectively. The International Committee on Standardized Genetic
                                    Nomenclature for Mice established the rules and guidelines for nomenclature of mouse
                                    and rat strains.</li>
                                <li>Investigators who use rodent models are responsible for accurate reporting of the

                                            in young animals but general anesthesia is required for animals older than
                                            21 days or if a repeated sampling in a single animal is necessary. Topical
                                            cetacaine or ethyl chloride sprays have been shown not to provide
                                            appropriate anesthesia/analgesia in mice and should not be used.
                                            Anesthetized animals have to be continuously monitored until fully awake.

                                        <li>The tail has to be swabbed at least once with a disinfectant such as iodine
                                            or chlorhexidine. Instruments used to cut the tail tip have to be sterile at
                                            the start of the procedure and should be sterilized between animals. This
                                            can be achieved by but is not limited to using a hot bead sterilizer, which
                                            not only will sterilize the scalpel blade or scissors but also can
                                            accomplish hemostasis of the tail wound.</li>
                                        <li>Instruments used for cutting need to be sharp (autoclaving will dull cutting
                                            parts of instruments and regular sharpening is required). Note that
                                            disposable scalpel blades are not designed to be used on multiple animals.

                                            Hemostasis can be achieved either by cauterization with hot instrument tips
                                            (see above comment), styptic powder, silver nitrate or simple digital

                                        <li>The working surface where the tail is cut should be wiped with alcohol in
                                            between animals to reduce DNA contamination between samples.</li>

                                            genotyping and identification of the animal at the same time.</li>
                                        <li>These methods do not require anesthesia and should be performed on animals
                                            close to weaning age or older to ensure the pinnae are large enough. If very

                                            may be lost.</li>
                                        <li>If done correctly ear tissue collection should not cause bleeding. If

                                        <li>This is a method using needle and ink to apply a permanent distinctive mark (e.g. number) at the dermis of the tail, toes, ears or foot pad of a rat or mouse. It can be performed on animals as young as 2 days old depending on the tattooing system used. Manual or electric equipment can be used.</li>
                                        <li>Anesthesia is not required when it is performed by trained personnel. Adult animals might need to be anesthetized for immobilization.</li>
                                        <li>The tattooing site has to be disinfected to minimize risk of infection.</li>
                                        <li>Commercial electrical equipment is available from various vendors requiring
                                                differing proficiencies of personnel.</li>
                                        <li>Injecting tattoo ink subcutaneously into the tail, hocks or toes producing a pattern of
                                                dots is used for identification of neonatal rats and mice.</li>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Microchip transponders implanted usually subcutaneously but also intraperitoneally are often used to track large numbers of animals and data (some microchips can also measure physiologic parameters) when interfaced with compatible computer software.</li>
                                        <li>Microchips have to be sterile and implantation has to follow aseptic technique.</li>
                                        <li>Subcutaneous microchip placement is performed like an injection with a large bore
                                                needle while intraperitoneal transponder implantation is considered a survival
                                                surgery and has to be described accordingly in the IACUC protocol.</li>
                                        <li>Microchip transponders can lead to tissue inflammation response or neoplasia with
                                                prolonged placement. It might not be compatible with advanced imaging procedures.</li>

                <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
                Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
                every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
                transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
                University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
                new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
                public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
                Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
                more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
                in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
                more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
                engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
