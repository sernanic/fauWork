                            <p>Public Health Policy (PHS) requires IACUCs to determine that methods of euthanasia
                                proposed in protocols meet criteria consistent with the recommendations of the American
                                Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). The NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare
                                (OLAW) requires that the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition
                                will be implemented by PHS Assured Institutions no later than September 1, 2013. AAALAC,
                                Int. has adopted the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition as
                                well. It can be accessed at <a

                                .
                                Unintended recovery of animals after apparent death constitutes serious noncompliance
                                with PHS Policy and serious deviation from the provisions of the Guide for the Care and
                                Use of Laboratory Animals.</p>

                                animals will be humanely euthanized, as detailed in the approved protocol. All

                                relevant technique(s) and need to be familiar with the details of the particular animal
                                care and use protocol as well as the provisions of this policy.</p>

                                        by a second physical form of euthanasia in rodents, amphibians and reptiles

                                <strong>Euthanasia - </strong>The term euthanasia is derived from the Greek terms eu
                                meaning "good" and thanatos meaning "death." A "good death" would be one that occurs
                                without pain and distress. In the context of this policy, euthanasia is the act of
                                inducing humane death in an animal. Euthanasia techniques should result in rapid
                                unconsciousness followed by cardiac or respiratory arrest and ultimately loss of brain
                                function. In addition, the technique should minimize any stress and anxiety experienced
                                by the animal prior to unconsciousness. Stress can be minimized by technical proficiency
                                and humane handling of the animals to be euthanized.<br /><br />
                                <strong>Humane</strong> is defined as "Characterized by kindness, mercy, or compassion,

                                            <strong>Manually applied blunt force trauma</strong> (cranial concussion) used to euthanize wild birds under
                                            field conditions is now considered unacceptable in conscious animals. However, the IACUC can grant approval when
                                            alternative methods are not feasible, or objectives of the study protocol provide a strong scientific
                                            justification. The IACUC will ascertain that training was provided and the individual(s) can show proficiency in
                                            this method. It must be followed by cervical dislocation. The continued approval will be re-evaluated by the
                                            IACUC as more evidence-based data become available.

                                        mice and rats. Precocial young (i.e., relatively mature and mobile newborn) such as guinea pigs need to be treated
                                        as adults with regards to euthanasia.</p>

                                                <li>Euthanasia of the dam does not require the removal of the fetuses from the womb
                                                    since mammals are unconscious in utero and hypoxia does not evoke a response. However, if fetuses ≥ 15

                                                    euthanized. This is best accomplished by decapitation.</li>

                                                    avoid direct contact of the neonate with the ice or a precooled surface.</li>

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
