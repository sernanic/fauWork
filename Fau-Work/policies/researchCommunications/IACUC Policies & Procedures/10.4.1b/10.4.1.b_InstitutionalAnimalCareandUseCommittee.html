                            <p>Florida Atlantic University (FAU) is committed to the humane care and use of animals in
                                activities related to
                                research, teaching and testing. The University has adopted institution-wide principles
                                regarding animal care
                                that are based on regulations set forth in the Public Health Service (PHS) policy on the
                                Humane Care and Use
                                of Animals and by the United States Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s (USDA) Animal
                                Welfare Act.</p>
                            <p>To accomplish the objectives inherent in these regulations and principles, FAU&rsquo;s
                                Institutional Animal
                                Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was established in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act
                                and PHS policy to
                                ensure the humane care and use of animals for research and education at the University.
                                The IACUC is
                                responsible for oversight of the animal care and use program and its components. It is
                                supported
                                administratively by the Research Integrity unit within the Division of Research, under

                            <h2>General Statement</h2>
                            <p>The Florida Atlantic University process for reviewing all research, teaching and testing
                                activities involving
                                vertebrate animals is carried out by the IACUC. The IACUC is appointed by the President
                                of the University
                                and the Vice President for Research (the Institutional Official (IO)) to implement
                                federal, state and
                                institutional policy. The IACUC is the institution&rsquo;s central oversight body for
                                matters relating to
                                the care, use and treatment of live vertebrate animals used for research, teaching and
                                testing activities.
                            </p>
                            <p>The IACUC is authorized to approve, request modifications in order to secure approval,
                                withhold approval, or
                                suspend animal research and teaching projects.</p>
                            <p>The IACUC follows the principles of the &ldquo;Three Rs&rdquo; when considering the
                                welfare of animals
                                involved, Reduction, Refinement, and Replacement. <strong>Reduction </strong>refers to
                                use of the minimum
                                number of animals possible to achieve scientifically rigorous results;
                                <strong>Refinement </strong>refers to
                                modification of procedures to minimize pain and distress that may occur in research; and
                                <strong>Replacement
                                </strong>refers to consideration of other non-animal models whenever possible to achieve
                                the same results.
                            </p>
                            <p>In addition to reviewing specific research projects, the IACUC also carries out other
                                federally mandated
                                functions such as reviewing and reporting on the overall animal program as well as
                                inspecting and evaluating
                                all animal facilities, laboratory space, and study areas at least once every six months.
                                It makes
                                recommendations to the Institutional Official based on this review regarding any aspect
                                of the animal
                                program, facilities or personnel training.</p>

                            <p>The IACUC will not conduct <u><strong>scientific merit review of protocols</strong></u>
                                involving the use of

                                protocols. Meeting agendas are distributed approximately 5 working days prior to the
                                scheduled meeting date.
                                The IACUC will follow the agenda topics at each scheduled committee meeting. Each action
                                will be following
                                by a motion, a second, and a vote. A majority of the quorum present is required to pass

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
