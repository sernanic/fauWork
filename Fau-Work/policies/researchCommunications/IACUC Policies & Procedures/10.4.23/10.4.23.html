                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>Cancer is a serious disease common to humans and many other animal species. The incidence
                                of cancer is increasing worldwide. Hence, research into the biological processes leading
                                to cancer, identifying potential carcinogens, and developing effective preventative
                                measures as well as treatments is a major scientific objective. Experimental animal
                                models of cancer allow for the collection of scientific and preclinical data not
                                available from in vitro or human epidemiological studies. Cancer, both spontaneous and
                                induced, can cause profound physiologic and metabolic changes in the research subject.
                                Laboratory animals can experience significant adverse effects not only due to the
                                induction of cancer but also due to investigative or treatment regimen. Therefore,
                                humane endpoints must be developed unique to each cancer study to protect animal welfare
                                while still achieving meaningful experimental outcomes.</p>

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>To establish a policy that will provide guidance to research personnel and animal care
                                staff on acceptable tumor endpoint criteria, to observe animal well-being while
                                achieving meaningful experimental outcomes, and comply with laws and regulations
                                governing animals in research, teaching and testing.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h2>General Statement</h2>
                            <p>Spontaneous tumor models, induction of tumor development and tumor implantation in
                                animals are critically important experiments to study biological processes, potential
                                environmental carcinogens and efficacious preventative and treatment measures. These
                                cancer models have the potential to induce pain and/or distress due to the physiologic
                                and metabolic changes expected. A key aspect of the animal welfare regulations is that
                                pain and distress in laboratory animals be prevented or minimized whenever possible.
                                Prevention and lessening of pain/distress is not only imperative for animal well-being
                                but also for the quality of research conducted. Therefore, it is the responsibility of
                                the Principal Investigator in conjunction with the Attending Veterinarian to find humane
                                endpoints that are meaningful. In addition, any cells or biological material injected in
                                an animal must be screened for murine or human pathogens depending on its source.</p>

                            <h2>Policy</h2>
                            <ol>

                                    <p>All injectable and/or implantable materials used for establishing tumors in
                                        animals must be described in the IACUC protocol. Murine derived materials must
                                        be tested for murine pathogens to avoid infecting resident rodent colonies if
                                        not already tested by the vendor. The AV as required by the IACUC will establish
                                        appropriate veterinary care and health surveillance programs including the
                                        review of test results of such materials. Tumors or cells derived from humans
                                        may potentially carry disease that could infect caretakers or technicians. Human
                                        tumor cell lines require IBC review and approval.</p>

                                        footpad, brain, muscle or tail restrict tumor expansion and should be avoided if

                                        challenges associated with the particular cancer studied on the animals
                                        involved.</p>

                                        allowable solid tumor size. The overriding consideration for humane endpoints of
                                        oncological experiments as well as spontaneous tumors must be the overall health
                                        of the animal.</p>

                                    <p>Research personnel must follow humane endpoint criteria outlined in the policy
                                        (see procedures). If these endpoint criteria interfere with experimental
                                        objectives the investigator must justify and describe it in the IACUC protocol.

                                        cancer bearing animals. Body weight, however, is often unreliable as a humane
                                        endpoint due to weight loss being set off by tumor growth/weight gain.
                                        Therefore, evaluation of the body score and developing distress scoring systems
                                        is often preferable.</p>

                                    characterized by uncontrolled, abnormal growth of cells in tissues or the blood,
                                    which may develop localized in specific tissues or cells or may spread from the

                                <li>The term </strong>Humane Endpoints </strong> describes the setting of clear,
                                    predictable and irreversible criteria that allow early termination of the
                                    experiments before the animal experiences significant harm while still meeting the
                                    experimental objectives. Humane endpoints are chosen to minimize or terminate the
                                    pain or distress of the experimental animals via euthanasia rather than waiting for
                                    their deaths as the endpoint.</li>
                                <li><strong>Death as an Endpoint</strong> refers to projects in which the animals’
                                    non-experimentally induced death is required as a measured data point. It does not
                                    refer to projects in which the animals will be euthanized prior to
                                    non-experimentally induced death for tissue collection or project termination.</li>
                                <li><strong>Moribundity</strong> is defined as "a dying state". Animals are considered
                                    to be moribundif they are in a debilitating physical state where death is imminent
                                    and treatment ineffectual.

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
