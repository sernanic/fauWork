                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Public Health Service (PHS) emphasize
                            proper documentation of animal care and use. Written records are a standard form of
                            documentation which verify experimental procedures and protocol compliance. As part of an
                            effective animal care and use program, research personnel working with animals must develop
                            and maintain accurate study records. The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
                            states that adequate recordkeeping is necessary for management of both colonies of
                            terrestrial species and systems of aquatic species. Adequate records are considered critical
                            for documenting animal well-being as well as tracking animal care and use at an institution.

                        <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        <p>To assist research personnel in determining the appropriate and necessary record- keeping for
                            animals in research, as mandated by federal laws and/or institutional, regulations, and
                            policies. Recordkeeping is addressed in several existing policies and regulations, which are
                            summarized in this reference document. In addition, the IACUC requires certain monitoring
                            and recordkeeping for animals that experience severe or prolonged pain or impairment as a
                            result of a study procedure which might not be specifically covered by an established
                            policy.</p>

                        <h2>General Statement</h2>
                        <p>Regulatory and accrediting agencies expect proper documentation of animal care and use as a
                            means for the institution to ensure compliance with research protocols and clinical care
                            procedures including but not limited to information on acquisition of animals, experimental
                            use, adequate pre- and post-procedural care, appropriate husbandry and veterinary care,
                            final disposition and adequate training of personnel working with animals. The extent of
                            records maintained varies based on the nature of the particular research study.</p>

                                animals. In addition, training provided to personnel working with animals must be
                                documented. Principal Investigators (PI) must also keep track of animal numbers by IACUC
                                protocol. For USDA covered species, PIs must track animal numbers by pain category. Various
                                forms of written documentation can be employed such as lab notebooks, electronic computer
                                records and specific forms as required by particular IACUC policies.</p>

                                database (i.e. VSATS) for animal number tracking purposes. If animals have been used in
                                prior research the IACUC is required to review such request to determine whether using that
                                particular animal(s) in another research study is appropriate based on animal welfare
                                considerations. The IACUC delegates this authority to the Attending Veterinarian (AV). If an
                                animal is experimentally naïve the animal numbers of the prior IACUC protocol will be

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
