                            <p>Both the Animal Welfare Act Regulations (AWAR &sect;2.31, e, 1 + 2) and the Public Health
                                Service Policy (PHS section IV, D, 1, b; Guide p.25) require that IACUC protocols
                                specify and include a rationale for the number of animals proposed to be used while
                                limiting to the appropriate quantity necessary to obtain valid results. This implicates
                                that institutions are required to establish mechanisms to monitor and document the
                                number of animals collected, acquired or produced and used in approved activities. The
                                Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) provides further guidance on what constitutes
                                an animal at which developmental stage. The Animal Welfare Act Regulations (AWAR
                                &sect;2.31, d, 1, x) and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th
                                edition, pg. 5) discuss and discourage animal reuse as a reduction strategy as well as
                                specify requirements for approval on a case by case basis.</p>

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>All research, testing, and teaching activities performed with vertebrate animals must be
                                approved by the IACUC and the numbers of animals used in these activities will be
                                accounted. This policy describes which animals require counting, the process of tracking
                                animal numbers, transfer of animals between protocols, reporting of adverse events, and
                                unanticipated deaths.</p>

                            <h2>General Statement</h2>
                            <p>Institutions are required to approve the use of vertebrate animals. Tracking the numbers
                                of animals is essential to assure only approved numbers have been used. The reasons for
                                identifying and tracking animal numbers are to a) fulfill federal obligations for
                                reporting animal use and assuring compliance with IACUC-approved activities and b) to
                                validate statistical significance and justify the experimental groups of animals in a
                                study, i.e. the</p>
                            <p>IACUC protocol. Realizing that precise accounting of animals is not always required nor
                                practical, it is reasonable to expect a valid estimation of animal numbers taking into
                                account unforeseen technical challenges or animal related complications such as
                                unexpected disease, death, or adverse events leading to early termination of
                                experiments.</p>

                                    <p>It may be difficult to forecast animal requirements accurately for the 3 year
                                        lifetime of an IACUC protocol since results and their impact on subsequent
                                        research direction cannot typically be predicted. Therefore, requested numbers
                                        of animals in an IACUC protocols should account for unforeseen technical
                                        challenges, experimental error, expected disease/death typical for the species
                                        and/or study incompatibility of individual animals. Requests for an additional
                                        10% of animals over the statistically justified experimental total is commonly
                                        accepted by the IAUC, especially when invasive procedures or trapping/catching
                                        of wildlife species are involved.</p>

                                        extra animals will be considered on a case by case basis in the context of
                                        protocol review.</p>

                                    <p>If it becomes apparent at any time during a study that additional animals will be
                                        needed, the IACUC protocol must be amended before more than the approved number
                                        of animals can be utilized. The IACUC expects a logical explanation of why
                                        previous estimations were incorrect and why more animals are needed.</p>

                                        independent of origin such as either being procured through a commercial vendor,
                                        produced within FAU animal facilities&rsquo; breeding colonies, caught in the

                                    <p>Embryos and fetuses are not counted but the breeder animals needed to produce
                                        those need to be tallied against approved animal numbers. PIs need to describe
                                        the number of embryos/fetuses and breeder animals needed in a study based on
                                        commonly expected reproductive data of the species in the relevant IACUC

                                        counted as soon as they hatch. OLAW states as an example that zebrafish larvae
                                        typically hatch 3 days post-fertilization.</p>

                                    <p>Although avian and other egg-laying vertebrate species develop backbones prior to
                                        hatching, the interpretation of the regulation by OLAW is such that the PHS
                                        Policy does not apply to those before hatching. PIs, however, are expected to
                                        inform the IACUC about the use of eggs (e.g. of chicken, turtle) in their
                                        research and a plan for their disposition including care or euthanasia if they
                                        hatch unexpectedly. PIs must complete the egg use form if not already included
                                        in another IACUC protocol.</p>

                                        and their environment must be counted. Federal regulation dictates that
                                        approximate numbers are addressed in the IACUC protocol.</p>

                                        painful/distressful procedures are involved. Any request for reuse of animals
                                        will be carefully reviewed by the IACUC on a case by case basis to determine the

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
