                                The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide, NRC 2011) states:
                                “Physical restraint is the use of manual or mechanical means to limit some or all of an
                                animal’s normal movement for the purpose of examination, collection of samples, drug
                                administration, therapy, or experimental manipulation.” The Guide distinguishes between
                                short-term and prolonged physical restraint and AAALAC, International expects prolonged
                                restraint being addressed in the institution’s Program Description.

                            <p>
                                It is sometimes necessary to physically restrain animals for research. This can be
                                necessary to achieve scientific objectives or to ensure the safety of the animal and
                                human handler. Nevertheless, restraint can be stressful and has the potential to cause
                                harm to the restrained animal under certain circumstances. Therefore, it is critical
                                that considerable care and training be employed.

                                    reinforcement techniques, to cooperate with research procedures. Animals that fail
                                    to adapt to the restraint device might have to be removed from the study in

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
