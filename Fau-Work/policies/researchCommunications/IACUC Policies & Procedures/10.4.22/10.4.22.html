                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>
                                The privilege of using animals in research is subject to three Congressional Acts: the
                                Health Research Extension Act, the Food Security Act, and the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).
                                The AWA details requirements for the care and use of animals in research, testing and
                                teaching, specifically in Subpart C, Section 2.32, “Personnel Qualification”. The Guide
                                for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition, based on the PHS Policy on
                                Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals also emphasizes proper training. Both, the AWA
                                and the Guide, agree that it is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure
                                that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians, and other personnel
                                involved in animal care and use are adequately educated, trained, and/or qualified in
                                basic and study- specific principles of laboratory animal science. Furthermore, it
                                states that “Training and instructions shall be made available, and the qualifications
                                of personnel reviewed, with sufficient frequency...” This applies to IACUC members as
                                well. The Guide stipulates that “it is the institution’s responsibility to ensure that
                                IACUC members are provided with training opportunities to understand their work and
                                role”.

                            <p>
                                An appropriate training program is an essential component of any Institutional Animal
                                Care and Use Program (ACUP). All personnel involved in the animal care and use program
                                at FAU must be adequately trained in the principles of laboratory animal science and the
                                ethical concerns surrounding animal use. The depth of training required will be
                                determined based on the tasks performed by each person, e.g. whether the person is part
                                of the oversight committee, performs hands-on experimental and/or care procedures, or is
                                responsible for supervision of personnel handling animals. The purpose of the ACUP
                                training program is to foster a philosophy of compassion and respect for the animals
                                used in research and teaching. Furthermore, it should provide participants with the
                                necessary knowledge and technical skills to perform required procedures to promote
                                quality science based on appropriate use of animals while preserving animal welfare.

                                        mandatory requirements of the IACUC. The IACUC may also decide what additional
                                        components of the training program are applicable depending on the individual’s
                                        involvement in the study. Proficiency of particular procedural techniques (e.g.

                                        with the AV and/or designee to discuss study design and IACUC protocol
                                        completion. During this meeting, experience with particular experimental
                                        procedures performed with/on animals will be discussed relative to the PI and
                                        all research personnel involved in the animal study. The PI is provided an
                                        opportunity during this meeting to discuss her/his experience in the protocol
                                        procedures. The AV or designee will review the material provided and details
                                        discussed and decide if additional training is needed. The IACUC delegates the
                                        authority to the Attending Veterinarian, or designee, to assess the experience
                                        of new research personnel in regards to animal related procedures and make a
                                        decision which of the two training tracks stated below research personnel have
                                        to follow.</p>

                                        practiced – that is, asepsis, gentle tissue handling, minimal dissection of

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
