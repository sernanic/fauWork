                <p>This policy applies to allegations of research misconduct (fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, 
                    performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results) involving:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A person who, at the time of the alleged research misconduct, was employed by, was an agent of, or was affiliated by
                        contract or agreement with Florida Atlantic University, including any courtesy (unpaid) appointments, also known as
                        Affiliate or Voluntary
                        appointments and graduate or undergraduate students conducting research at FAU; and</li>
                    <li>Any of (1) research, research training or activities related to that research or research
                        training, such as the operation of tissue and data banks and the dissemination of research
                        information, (2) applications or proposals for behavioral research, research training or activities related to that
                        research or research training, or (3) plagiarism of research records produced in the course of research, research
                        training or activities related to that research or research training. This includes any research proposed,
                        performed, reviewed, or reported, or any research record generated from that research, regardless of whether an
                        application or proposal resulted in a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other form of support.

                </ul>
                <p>This policy and the associated procedures do not apply to authorship or collaboration disputes and apply only to
                    allegations of research
                    misconduct that occurred within 6 years of the date the FAU received the allegation. Authorship or collaboration
                    disputes involving students should be directed to the dean of undergraduate
                    or graduate studies, as applicable.
                </p> <br/>
                <p>While this policy is based upon the model policy of the US Public Health Service (PHS) and has been crafted in close
                    accordance with PHS Regulations
                    (specifically Code of Federal Regulations Title 42, Part 93), it is intended to be FAU’s institutional policy
                    applicable to all research conducted by any FAU institutional member, paid or unpaid, regardless of the location of
                    the research or the source of the funding. This policy is intended both to carry FAU’s responsibilities under the
                    various agency policies on Research Misconduct and to set
                    out a process for the resolution of any and all instances of research misconduct.

                <h2>POLICY STATEMENT:</h2>
                <p>Florida Atlantic University (“University” or “FAU”) requires ethical conduct in all teaching and research.
                    Collegiality, respect, and trust among faculty members, students, and staff are essential to FAU’s success. All
                    allegations of research misconduct must be resolved promptly and equitably using procedures that safeguard the
                    rights of all faculty, staff and students concerned. This policy is adopted by FAU in compliance and consistent with
                    laws, rules and regulations of the United States, the State of Florida, the Florida Board of Governors, the Florida
                    Atlantic University Board of Trustees, and, for those employees included in the bargaining unit, the FAU Board of
                    Trustees/United Faculty of Florida Collective Bargaining Agreement. It will
                    be updated administratively in accordance with changes in those laws, rules, and regulations.

                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>
                        As noted, this FAU Research Misconduct policy is motivated by and flows from the model policy of the US Public Health
                        Service (Department of Health and Human Services), which was developed as a link among misconduct policies of several
                        federal agencies. Given the serious nature of the subject of this policy and its quasi-legal implications, this document
                        involves a high level of detail and specificity.
                        In addition, various terms have specific definitions; see Appendix B (p. 22). <br /> <br />
                        Notwithstanding its basis in the PHS model and the definitions in Appendix B (which follow federal language), this
                        policy is a Florida Atlantic University document, and it applies to all research at FAU regardless of funding source.
                        Because the procedures discussed below are complicated, the following table provides a step-by-step overview of the time
                        line with references to the sections of this document. For completeness here, the four major steps in the process are
                        subdivided into their several components. The table, however, is not meant to be
                        comprehensive concerning the details of the procedure or its rationale. <br /> <br />
                        In brief, (i) allegations of misconduct are (ii) assessed by the Research Integrity Officer; if warranted, an (iii)
                        inquiry committee is formed to gather background and provide the Deciding Officer with sufficient information to pursue
                        an (iv) investigation. At each stage of the process, comments from the Respondent (those against whom the allegations
                        have been made) are included in the process. It is possible to extend some of the steps in the
                        process (notably (5) and (11) in the table below) if warranted and documented appropriately.

                    <p>
                        All institutional members will report observed, suspected, or apparent research misconduct to
                        the Research Integrity Officer (RIO), who is the Vice President for Research or his/her designee.
                        Any official who receives an allegation of research misconduct must report it immediately to the RIO.
                        If an individual is unsure whether a suspected incident falls within the definition of research misconduct, he or she
                        may meet with or contact the RIO at the Division of Research to discuss the suspected research misconduct informally;
                        this may include discussing it anonymously and/or hypothetically. If the circumstances described by the individual do
                        not meet the definition of research misconduct, the RIO will refer the individual or allegation to other offices or
                        officials with responsibility for resolving the problem. Faculty members have the responsibility to oversee all
                        students, graduate and undergraduate, conducting research under their supervision. This includes, to the extent
                        possible, ensuring that the tenets
                        for the responsible conduct of research are known and followed by these students. <br /> <br />
                        At any time, an institutional member may have confidential discussions and consultations about concerns of possible
                        misconduct with the RIO and
                        will be counseled about appropriate procedures for reporting allegations.

                                    The Deciding Official (DO), who is the University Provost or designee, will receive the inquiry report and, after
                                    consulting with the RIO, decide whether an investigation is warranted. Any finding that an investigation is
                                    warranted must be made in writing by the DO and will be provided to the Cognizant Agency as appropriate, together
                                    with a copy of the inquiry report, within 30 days of the finding. If it is found that an investigation is not
                                    warranted, the DO and the RIO will ensure that detailed documentation of the inquiry is retained for at least 7
                                    years after termination of the inquiry, so that the Cognizant Agency may assess the reasons why the FAU decided not

                                    The DO will receive the investigation report and, after consulting with the RIO and other appropriate officials,

                                    found, decide what, if any, institutional administrative actions are appropriate. This includes administrative
                                    actions by the DO acting as the University Provost or the DO referring the matter to another university committee
                                    for further review and potential administrative action against faculty or students. The DO shall ensure that the

                                    action are provided to the Cognizant Agency as required.

                                <p>
                                    Upon receiving an allegation of research misconduct, the RIO will immediately assess the allegation to determine
                                    whether it is sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence of research misconduct may be
                                    identified, whether it is within the jurisdictional criteria of this policy, and whether the allegation falls within
                                    the definition of research misconduct in this policy. An inquiry must be conducted if these criteria are met. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    The assessment period should be brief, preferably concluded within 5 days. In conducting the assessment, the RIO
                                    need not interview the Complainant, Respondent, or other witnesses, or gather data beyond any that may have been
                                    submitted with the allegation, except as necessary to determine whether the allegation is sufficiently credible and
                                    specific so that potential evidence of research misconduct may be identified. The RIO shall, on or before the date
                                    on which the
                                    Respondent is notified of the allegation, obtain custody of, inventory, and sequester all research records and
                                    evidence needed to conduct the research misconduct proceeding, as provided in paragraph B.3 below.

                                    If the RIO determines that the criteria for an inquiry are met, he or she will immediately initiate the inquiry
                                    process. The purpose of the inquiry is to conduct an initial review of the available evidence to determine whether
                                    to conduct an investigation. An inquiry
                                    does not require a full review of all the evidence related to the allegation.
                                </p>

                                <i>Notice to Respondent; Sequestration of Research Records</i> <br/><br/>
                                <p>
                                    At the time of or before beginning an inquiry, the RIO must make a good faith effort to notify the Respondent in
                                    writing, if the Respondent is known. If the inquiry subsequently identifies additional Respondents, they must be
                                    notified in writing. On or before the date on which the Respondent is notified, or the inquiry begins, whichever is
                                    earlier, the RIO must take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all the research records and
                                    evidence needed to conduct the research misconduct proceeding, inventory the records and evidence and sequester them
                                    in a secure manner, except that where the research records or evidence encompass scientific instruments shared by a
                                    number of users, custody may be limited to copies of the data or evidence on such instruments, so long as those
                                    copies are substantially equivalent to the evidentiary value of the instruments. The RIO may consult with the
                                    Cognizant Agency for advice and assistance in this regard.

                                <p>
                                    The RIO, in consultation with other institutional officials as appropriate, will appoint an inquiry committee and
                                    committee chair within 10 days of receipt of the allegation, if the allegation is one of research misconduct, or as soon
                                    thereafter as practical. The inquiry committee must consist of faculty who do not have unresolved personal,
                                    professional, or financial conflicts of interest with those involved with the inquiry and should include individuals
                                    with the appropriate scientific expertise to evaluate the evidence and issues related to the allegation, interview the
                                    principals and key witnesses, and conduct the inquiry. The RIO may use additional experts when necessary to evaluate
                                    specific allegations. The RIO will notify the Respondent of the proposed committee membership to give the Respondent an
                                    opportunity to object to a proposed member based upon a personal, professional, or financial conflict of interest. The
                                    Respondent has 5 calendar days to submit objections. The DO will make the final determination of whether a conflict
                                    exists.

                                <p>The RIO will prepare a charge for the inquiry committee that:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sets forth the time for completion of the inquiry;</li>
                                    <li>Describes the allegations and any related issues identified during the allegation
                                            assessment;</li>
                                    <li>States that the purpose of the inquiry is to conduct an initial review of the evidence,
                                        including the testimony of the Respondent, Complainant and key witnesses, to determine whether an investigation is
                                        warranted, not to determine whether research misconduct definitely occurred or who was responsible;</li>
                                    <li>States that an investigation is warranted if the committee determines: (1) there is a reasonable basis for
                                        concluding that the allegation falls within the definition of research misconduct and is within the jurisdictional
                                        criteria of this policy; and, (2) the allegation may have substance, based on the committee's review during the
                                        inquiry.</li>
                                    <li>Informs the inquiry committee that they are responsible for preparing or directing the preparation of a written
                                        report of the inquiry that meets the requirements of this policy.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    At the committee's first meeting, the RIO will review the charge with the committee, discuss the allegations, any
                                    related issues, and the appropriate procedures for conducting the inquiry, assist the committee with organizing
                                    plans for the inquiry, and answer any questions raised by the committee. The RIO will be present or available
                                    throughout the inquiry to advise the committee as needed.

                                <p>
                                    The inquiry committee will normally interview the Complainant, the Respondent, and key witnesses, as well as examine
                                    relevant research records and materials. Then the inquiry committee will evaluate the evidence, including the
                                    testimony obtained during the inquiry. After consultation with the RIO, the committee members will decide whether an
                                    investigation is warranted based on the criteria in this policy. The scope of the inquiry is not required to and
                                    does not normally include deciding whether misconduct definitely occurred, determining definitely who committed the
                                    research misconduct, or conducting exhaustive interviews and analyses. However, if a legally sufficient admission of
                                    research misconduct is made by the Respondent, misconduct may be determined at the inquiry stage if all relevant
                                    issues are resolved. In that case, the institution shall promptly consult with the Cognizant Agency to determine the
                                    next steps that should be taken. See Section C.3 below.

                                    investigation is warranted, must be completed within 20 calendar days of receipt of allegation, unless the RIO
                                    determines that circumstances clearly warrant a longer period. If the RIO approves an extension, the inquiry record
                                    must include documentation of the reasons for exceeding the 20-day period. The Respondent should be notified of the
                                    extension.

                                    Respondent; (2) a description of the allegations of research misconduct; (3) the funding source, including, for
                                    example, grant numbers, grant applications, contracts and publications listing the support; (4) the basis for
                                    recommending or not recommending that the allegations warrant an investigation; (5) any comments on the draft report
                                    by the Respondent or Complainant. The inquiry report should also include: the names and titles of the committee

                                    reviewed; summaries of any interviews; and whether any other actions should be taken if an investigation is not
                                    recommended. <br/> <br/>
                                    Institutional counsel should review the report for legal sufficiency. Modifications should be made as appropriate in
                                    consultation with the RIO and the inquiry committee.

                                    The investigation must begin within 30 calendar days after the determination by the DO that an investigation is
                                    warranted. The purpose of the investigation is to develop a factual record by exploring the allegations in detail
                                    and examining the evidence in depth, leading to recommended findings on whether research misconduct has been
                                    committed, by whom, and to what extent. The investigation will also determine whether there are additional instances
                                    of possible research misconduct that would justify broadening the scope beyond the initial allegations. This is
                                    particularly important where the alleged research misconduct involves clinical trials or potential harm to human
                                    subjects or the general public or if it affects research that forms the basis for public policy, clinical practice,
                                    or public health practice. The findings of the investigation will be set forth in an investigation report

                                <p>
                                    On or before the date on which the investigation begins, the RIO must: (1) notify the Cognizant Agency Director of
                                    the decision to begin the investigation and provide the Cognizant Agency a copy of the inquiry report; and (2)
                                    notify the Respondent in writing of the allegations to be investigated. The RIO must also give the Respondent
                                    written notice of any new allegations of research misconduct within a reasonable amount of time of deciding to
                                    pursue allegations not addressed during the inquiry or in the initial notice of the investigation. <br/><br/>
                                    The RIO will, prior to notifying Respondent of the allegations, take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain
                                    custody of and sequester in a secure manner all research records and evidence needed to conduct the research
                                    misconduct investigation that were not previously sequestered during the inquiry. Where the research records or
                                    evidence encompass scientific instruments shared by a number of users, custody may be limited to copies of the data
                                    or evidence on such instruments, so long as those copies are substantially equivalent to the evidentiary value of
                                    the instruments. The need for additional sequestration of records for the investigation may occur for any number of
                                    reasons, including the institution's decision to investigate additional allegations not considered during the
                                    inquiry stage or the identification of records during the inquiry process that had not been previously secured. The
                                    procedures to be followed for sequestration during the investigation are the same procedures that apply during the
                                    inquiry.

                                    The RIO, in consultation with other institutional officials as appropriate, will appoint an investigation committee
                                    and the committee chair within 10 days of the beginning of the investigation or as soon thereafter as practical. The
                                    investigation committee must consist of faculty who do not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial
                                    conflicts of interest with those involved with the investigation and should include individuals with the appropriate
                                    scientific expertise to evaluate the evidence and issues related to the allegation, interview the Respondent and
                                    Complainant and conduct the investigation. Individuals appointed to the investigation committee may also have served
                                    on the inquiry committee. When necessary to secure the necessary expertise or to avoid conflicts of interest, the
                                    RIO may select committee members from outside the institution. The RIO will notify the Respondent of the proposed
                                    committee membership to give the Respondent an opportunity to object to a proposed member based upon a personal,
                                    professional, or financial conflict of interest. The Respondent has 5 calendar days to file an objection. The DO
                                    will make the final determination of whether a conflict exists.

                                    The RIO will assist the investigation committee in finalizing the draft investigation report, including ensuring
                                    that the Respondent's comments are included and considered, and transmit the final investigation report to the DO,
                                    who will determine within 5 days in writing: (1) whether the institution accepts the investigation report, its
                                    findings, and the recommended institutional actions; and (2) the appropriate institutional actions in response to
                                    the accepted findings of research misconduct. If this determination varies from the findings of the investigation
                                    committee, the DO will, as part of his/her written determination, explain in detail the basis for rendering a
                                    decision different from the findings of the investigation committee. Alternatively, the DO may return the report to
                                    the investigation committee with a request for further fact-finding or analysis. <br/><br/>
                                    When a final decision on the case has been reached, the RIO will normally notify both the Respondent and the
                                    Complainant in writing. After informing the Cognizant Agency, the DO will determine whether law enforcement
                                    agencies, professional societies, professional licensing boards, editors of journals in which falsified reports may
                                    have been published, collaborators of the Respondent in the work, or other relevant parties should be notified of
                                    the outcome of the case. The RIO is responsible for ensuring compliance with all notification requirements of
                                    funding or sponsoring agencies.

                                <p>The RIO must maintain and provide to the Cognizant Agency upon request records of research misconduct proceedings.
                                    Unless custody has been transferred to the Cognizant Agency or the Cognizant Agency has advised in writing that the

                                        The termination of the Respondent's FAU affiliation, by resignation, withdrawal or otherwise, before or after an
                                        allegation of possible research misconduct has been reported, will not preclude or terminate the research misconduct
                                        proceeding or otherwise limit any of the FAU's responsibilities.
                                        If the Respondent, without admitting to the misconduct, elects to resign his or her position after the institution
                                        receives an allegation of research misconduct, the assessment of the allegation will proceed, as well as the inquiry
                                        and investigation, as appropriate based on the outcome of the preceding steps. If the Respondent refuses to
                                        participate in the process after resignation, the RIO and any inquiry or investigation committee will use their best
                                        efforts to reach a conclusion concerning the allegations, noting in the report the Respondent's failure to cooperate

                                        Following a final finding of no research misconduct, including the Cognizant Agency concurrence, the RIO will, at
                                        the request of the Respondent, undertake all reasonable and practical efforts to restore the Respondent's
                                        reputation. Depending on the particular circumstances and the views of the Respondent, the RIO should consider
                                        notifying those individuals aware of or involved in the investigation of the final outcome, publicizing the final
                                        outcome in any forum in which the allegation of research misconduct was previously publicized, and expunging all
                                        reference to the research misconduct allegation from the Respondent's personnel file. Any institutional actions to restore the Respondent's reputation should first be approved by the DO.

                                        Cognizant Agency determines that research misconduct occurred, the RIO will undertake all reasonable and practical
                                        efforts to protect the position and reputation of, or to counter potential or actual retaliation against, any
                                        Complainant who made allegations of research misconduct in good faith and of any witnesses and committee members who
                                        cooperate in good faith with the research misconduct proceeding, including students involved in the process. The DO
                                        will determine, after consulting with the RIO, and with the Complainant, witnesses, or committee members,
                                        respectively, what steps, if any, are needed to restore their respective positions or reputations or to counter

                                        faith, or whether a witness or committee member acted in good faith. If the DO determines that there was an absence
                                        of good faith he/she will determine whether any administrative action should be taken against the person who failed
                                        to act in good faith.

                       <i>Allegation</i> Allegation means a disclosure of possible research misconduct through any means of
                            communication. The disclosure may be by written or oral statement or other communication to
                            an institutional or Cognizant Agency official. The written allegation(s) will be date stamped. In
                            the event that, the allegation is made verbally, the RIO or designee shall promptly reduce it to
                            writing and date stamp the allegation as received on that date. In the event the allegation is
                            received electronically, the RIO, or designee, will date stamp the document immediately upon
                            receipt. <br/><br/>
                            
                           <i>Cognizant agency</i>, is the organization associated with the funding source for the research
                            activity in question that is responsible for matters involving research misconduct. For example,
                            the Cognizant Agency for research funded by the National Institutes of Health is the HHS Office
                            of Research Integrity.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Complainant</i>  means a person who in good faith makes an allegation of research misconduct.<br/><br/>
                            Days are calendar days, not business days.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Deciding Official (DO)</i>  is the University Provost, or designee. The DO is the institutional official
                            who makes final determinations on allegations of research misconduct and any institutional
                            administrative actions. The Deciding Official will not be the same individual as the Research
                            Integrity Officer and should have no direct prior involvement in the institution's inquiry,
                            investigation, or allegation assessment. A Deciding Official’s appointment of an individual to
                            assess allegations of research misconduct, or to serve on an inquiry or investigation committee,
                            is not considered to be direct prior involvement.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Evidence</i>  means any document, tangible item, or testimony offered or obtained during a
                            research misconduct proceeding that tends to prove or disprove the existence of an alleged
                            fact.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Good faith</i> , as applied to a Complainant or witness, means having a belief in the truth of one’s
                            allegation or testimony that a reasonable person in the Complainant’s or witness’s position
                            could have based on the information known to the Complainant or witness at the time. An
                            allegation or cooperation with a research misconduct proceeding is not in good faith if it is made
                            with knowing or reckless disregard for information that would negate the allegation or testimony.
                            Good faith as applied to a committee member, faculty, or student means cooperating with the
                            purpose of helping an institution meet its responsibilities. A committee member does not act in
                            good faith if his/her acts or omissions on the committee are dishonest or influenced by personal,
                            professional, or financial conflicts of interest with those involved in the research misconduct
                            proceeding.<br/><br/>
                            <i>HHS means</i>  the United States Department of Health and Human Services.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Inquiry</i>  means preliminary information-gathering and preliminary fact-finding that meets the
                            criteria and follows the procedures herein.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Institutional</i>  member means a person who is employed by, is an agent of, or is affiliated by
                            contract or agreement with an institution. Institutional members may include, but are not limited to, officials, tenured and untenured faculty, teaching and support staff, researchers, research
                            coordinators, clinical technicians, postdoctoral and other fellows, students, volunteers, agents,
                            and contractors, subcontractors, and sub-awardees, and their employees.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Investigation</i>  means the formal development of a factual record and the examination of that
                            record leading to a decision not to make a finding of research misconduct or to a
                            recommendation for a finding of research misconduct that may include a recommendation for
                            other appropriate actions, including administrative actions.<br/><br/>
                            <i> Office of Research Integrity (the Cognizant Agency for HHS)</i> means the office to which the HHS
                            Secretary has delegated responsibility for addressing research integrity and misconduct issues
                            related to PHS supported activities.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Preponderance of the evidence</i>  means proof by information that, compared with that opposing
                            it, leads to the conclusion that the fact at issue is more probably true than not.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Public Health Service (PHS)</i>  means the unit within HHS that includes the Office of Public Health
                            and Science and the following Operating Divisions: Agency for Healthcare Research and

                            Health Services Administration, and the offices of the Regional Health Administrators.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Records of research misconduct proceedings</i>  means: (1) the research records and evidence
                            secured for the research misconduct proceeding pursuant to this policy and Cognizant Agency
                            regulations, except to the extent the Research Integrity Officer determines and documents that
                            those records are not relevant to the proceeding or that the records duplicate other records that
                            have been retained; (2) the documentation of the determination of irrelevant or duplicate
                            records; (3) the inquiry report and final documents (not drafts) produced in the course of
                            preparing that report, including the documentation of any decision not to investigate; (4) the

                            sufficiently specific so that potential evidence of research misconduct may be identified; and (2)
                            overseeing inquiries and investigations; and (3) the other responsibilities described in this
                            policy. In the event the RIO has a conflict of interest, then the RIO will refer the matter to the

                            Committee.<br/><br/>
                            <i>Research misconduct</i>  means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or
                            reviewing research, or in reporting research results. Fabrication is making up data or results and
                            recording or reporting them. Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or
                            processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
