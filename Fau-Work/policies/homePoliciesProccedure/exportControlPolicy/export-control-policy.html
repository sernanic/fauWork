                                <p>
                                        Export control laws and regulations exist to protect national security and U.S. foreign
                                        policy interests. These laws and regulations place restrictions on the export and release
                                        of certain items, Technology, Technical Data, and services outside of the U.S. and to
                                        Foreign Persons, whether located in the U.S. (“Deemed Export”) or abroad (“Export”).
                                        Although many of the activities Florida Atlantic University (“FAU”) undertakes are
                                        excluded from export control, the University recognizes the importance of complying with
                                        all federal laws and regulations. This policy is designed to assist the University
                                        community in its efforts to operate in accordance with U.S. export control laws and
                                        regulations.

                                <p>
                                        The purpose of this policy is to facilitate compliance with U.S. export control laws and
                                        regulations by establishing roles and responsibilities, and to educate FAU’s community
                                        on such laws and regulations.

                                        All FAU faculty, staff, students, postdoctoral fellows, postdoctoral scholars, visiting
                                        scholars, visiting scientists, and anyone who is paid by, or engaged by, FAU (“FAU

                                        Personnel are required to adhere to all FAU policies and procedures to maintain federal,
                                        state, and institutional compliance.

                                <h3>Statement</h3>
                                <p>
                                        Florida Atlantic University is committed to complying with all U.S. laws and regulations in
                                        its operation. As such, all FAU Personnel are required to comply with U.S. export control
                                        laws and regulations. FAU Personnel are responsible for the lawful transfer, control,
                                        maintenance, storage, access, and dissemination of certain items, Technology,
                                        Technical Data, and services outside of the U.S. or to Foreign Persons, whether located
                                        in the U.S. or abroad. <br/>The laws that regulate the export and release of certain items, Technology, Technical
                                        Data, and services are enforced primarily by three agencies: The U.S. Department of
                                        State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Treasury. <br/>The U.S. Department of State, through the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls
                                        (“DDTC”), regulates “Defense Articles” and “Defense Services” in the International
                                        Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). Items and information subject to ITAR are found
                                        under the DDTC’s U.S. Munitions List (“USML”). The U.S. Department of Commerce,
                                        through the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) and the BIS’s Export Administration
                                        Regulations (“EAR”), regulates “dual-use” items, which are items that have both
                                        commercial and potential military applications. Items and information subject to EAR are
                                        found under the Commerce Control List (“CCL”). The U.S. Department of Treasury
                                        maintains the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) which enforces economic
                                        sanctions and embargoes in transactions and exchanges with designated countries,
                                        entities, and individuals. <br/> In certain circumstances, the export or release of certain items, Technology, Technical
                                        Data, or services out of the U.S. or to Foreign Persons, whether in the U.S. or abroad, is
                                        either prohibited by law, requires an export license granted by the appropriate agency, or
                                        other governmental approval. Instances that may require an export license or
                                        governmental approval include, but are not limited to, sponsored research at FAU
                                        involving controlled items, including dual-use items, research conducted outside of the
                                        U.S., international travel, international shipping, hosting foreign scholars, and DeemedExport visa certifications. <br/>Obtaining an export license is not guaranteed. Depending on the sensitivity of the item,
                                        Technology, Technical Data, parties, and/or countries involved, the U.S. government
                                        may take between three (3) to six (6) months to review and approve or deny an
                                        application for an export license. Before an export license is obtained, or determining
                                        that an export control exclusion is applicable, no access to, or conduct of, export
                                        controlled activities are permitted by FAU Personnel. <br/>FAU Personnel have an obligation to report any violation or suspected violation of export
                                        control laws, regulations, and policies. Such reports can be made to FAU’s Division of
                                        Research Export Control Officer or the Vice President for Research. All reports of
                                        violations or suspected violations of export control laws, regulations, or policies will be
                                        reviewed. If an investigation is warranted, FAU’s Division of Research will lead the investigation, with involvement/advisement from the Office of General Counsel as
                                        needed. Violations of U.S. export control laws and regulations are severe and can be
                                        imposed against both the individual as well as the university. The civil and criminal
                                        penalties for violating export control laws and regulations include significant monetary
                                        fines, debarment from participating in federal contracting, and imprisonment for
                                        individuals. In addition to any government imposed sanctions, any FAU Personnel found
                                        to be acting in violation of U.S. export control laws, regulations, or FAU’s export control
                                        policies and procedures will be subject to disciplinary action by the University

                                        Fundamental Research Exclusion <br/>Basic and applied research in science and engineering performed at accredited
                                        institutions of higher education in the U.S., the results of which are ordinarily published
                                        and shared broadly within the scientific community, are excluded from export control
                                        laws and regulations. The Fundamental Research Exclusion is only applicable to the
                                        export or release of research data and information, not the export of tangible items. <br/>Research no longer qualifies under the Fundamental Research Exclusion when there
                                        are publication restrictions beyond limited pre-publication review to prevent inadvertent
                                        disclosures of proprietary trade secret information. In addition, the Fundamental
                                        Research Exclusion is no longer applicable when Foreign Persons are prohibited from
                                        participating in the research. <br/>Publicly Available/Public Domain Exclusion <br/>Information which is published and generally accessible or available to the public:

                                        published information; (3) through second class mailing privileges granted by the U.S.
                                        Government; (4) at libraries open to the public or from which the public can obtain
                                        documents; (5) through patents available at any patent office; (6) through unlimited

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
