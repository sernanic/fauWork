					<h3> I. Background</h3>
					<div id="paragraph">
						<p>Faculty-level research appointments, identified by the titles of <i>Research Assistant Professor, Research
								Associate Professor</i>, or <i>Research Professor, </i>are intended to offer a research career pathway to
							individuals with experience and scholarly qualifications comparable to regular tenure-track and tenured faculty
							members. Appointees are professional researchers who are interested in and capable of independent investigation
							and publication, and who support the research mission of the University by assisting a department or center to
							achieve its research goals. Their research should complement the research programs of regular faculty members in
							the department or center. Although they are not normally assigned instructional responsibilities, they may teach
							courses appropriate to their background when it is mutually acceptable to them and to the department and
							occasionally take part in upper level or graduate teaching or seminar activities <br />
							<br />Research faculty are not eligible for tenure. These appointments are normally funded from sponsored
							projects or other non-appropriated University funds; are contingent upon the availability of funding and should
							be at a rate comparable to that of regular faculty of the same rank. These appointments cannot extend beyond the
							period of availability of supporting funds. Research faculty may serve as principal investigators or project
							directors on research awards and are expected to seek independent external funding.<br />
							<br />Faculty-level research appointments must be approved by the Vice President for Research. Appointments may
							be for a fixed term, typically from one to three years, but must be contingent on the availability of funds;
							although the appointment may be for a longer term, employment contracts funded by grants cannot extend beyond
							the termination date of the funding. Appointments are normally full-time. In some cases, part-time appointments
							can be made when it is mutually agreeable to the candidate and the department or center and when the work effort
							is consistent with the salary paid. For cases where an appointee’s salary is paid from and outside source he may
							be offered an unpaid appointment. University policies pertain to faculty-level research appointees, including
							but not limited to the University Patent Policy, Policy on Faculty Conflict of Commitment and Conflict of
							Interest,<br />
							<br />Policy on Integrity in Research and Procedures for Reviewing Alleged Misconduct, Policy on Employment of
							Relatives and the Annual Leave Policy for Contract and Grant Employees.

					<h3>II. PROCEDURES</h3> 
					<div id="paragraph">
						<p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Since research faculty appointments will
							normally be supported by sponsored program funds, it may not be appropriate to conduct searches in the same way
							as for regular faculty. Nevertheless, affirmative action approval may have to be obtained before an appointment
							can be made. In this instance the Equal Opportunity Compliance office should be contacted to determine if
							approval is required. <br />
							<br /> Research faculty appointments may be made either in academic departments or in research centers or
							institutes. In an academic department, the recommendation to appoint a research faculty member should be
							forwarded to the dean in accordance with departmental and college procedures established for regular faculty
							appointments. In centers and institutes, the recommendation for a faculty-level research appointment should be
							made by the center director, who forwards the recommendation to the dean of the college in which the center
							reports in accordance with procedures established by the center. The approval of all individuals whose accounts
							will provide funding for the appointment is required. <br />
							<br />The college dean or the University center director forwards the recommendation packet for a faculty-level
							research appointment to the Vice President for Research. This recommendation packet must include a resume, an
							unofficial transcript, supporting documents that would be appropriate for a regular faculty appointment, and a
							draft letter of appointment. The letter of appointment must specify the appointee’s salary and term of
							appointment and the basis for evaluation. It must indicate that the appointment is contingent upon the
							availability of continuing resources and state that it is for a non-tenure-eligible position.

				<h3>III. SALARY AND BENEFITS</h3>
				<div id="paragraph">
					<p>Salary ranges for research faculty should be reasonably commensurate with those for regular faculty at the same
						rank and in the same professional area. Research faculty should be reviewed for annual salary increases at the
						same time and in the same way that regular faculty are reviewed, based on their assignments. Salary increases
						should be commensurate with those of equivalent regular faculty positions. <br />
				
						<br /> Research faculty are eligible for certain benefits which may include vacation and sick leave, health and
						dental plans, certain insurance and pretax options, and several retirement plans. Actual benefits will be
						determined at the time of offer. The prevailing fringe benefit rate will be charged to the sponsored account
						that is the source of salary funds. Research faculties accrue annual leave and sick time in accordance with
						standard university policy and the Annual Leave Policy for Contract and Grant Employees. Reduction of benefits

					<h3>IV. REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE</h3>
					<div id="paragraph">
							<p>Members of the research faculty should be evaluated with the same rigor as tenure-track faculty. A research faculty
								member’s research activity, including publications, grant applications, and external funding, shall be reviewed at
								the time of any reappointment or promotion by a duly constituted departmental or center faculty committee in
								accordance with procedures established by the college or center. This committee’s recommendation is then forwarded
								by the college dean or center director to the Vice President for Research. Appointees are normally judged by their
								success in securing external funding and their potential for continued independence, autonomy, and excellence. It is
								expected that an appointee will be reviewed for promotion after an appropriate number of years of service in the
								assistant or associate professor rank.

						<h3>V. PROCEDURES FOR REAPPOINTMENT</h3>
						<div id="paragraph">
							<p>For reappointment, the research faculty member must be reviewed and approved by a departmental committee or by a
								committee of faculty affiliated with the center or institute, depending upon the basis for the appointment. This
								should include an evaluation of the appointee’s research activity and contribution to the department or center
								research effort, as well as the appointee’s record with respect to securing independent external funding. The
								reappointment procedure is to be evidenced by the issuance of a continuing employment contract to the appointee, a
								copy of which must be sent to the Division of Research.

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
