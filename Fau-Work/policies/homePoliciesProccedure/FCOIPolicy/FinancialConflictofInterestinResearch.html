                        Florida Atlantic University and its employees are committed to conducting themselves and their research activities in
                        accordance with the highest standards. The University recognizes that actual or perceived conflicts of interest may
                        occur in the normal conduct of research and other activities. It is essential that investigators disclose their and
                        their family members’ financial interests. Only after disclosure of a significant financial interest, can the University
                        make an informed determination about a particular activity and require the appropriate oversight, limitations or
                        prohibitions in accordance with this policy and if applicable, federal regulations.

                                Sponsored Programs. All applications for funding from an external agency may not be submitted to Sponsored Programs
                                until all investigators have completed and submitted, the required disclosure forms. Disclosure forms must be completed

                        acquired. Disclosures under this provision related to intellectual property shall be updated prior to the execution
                        of any contract, license, or other transaction involving the intellectual property. The Vice President for Research
                        (VPR) may also require an investigator to update a disclosure at any time. <br/><br/>

                        provision will be forwarded to Research Integrity to process once an indication is received by Sponsored Programs of
                        imminent funding. In any instance where the required disclosure form is not submitted with the proposal submission
                        to Sponsored Programs, the disclosure form shall be solicited directly from the investigator.

                    <u>Training</u> <br/>
                    <p>
                        Several federal agencies including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF)
                        require mandatory Conflict of Interest (COI) training. FAU has implemented this training for all researchers. FAU
                        uses the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Conflict of Interest training module to fulfill this
                        mandatory requirement. http://www.citiprogram.org. <br/> <br/>
                        The Division of Research requests researchers complete training within 30 days of a proposal submission. Effective
                        January 1, 2016, account set up for all funded awards, regardless of funding source, will not proceed without
                        completion of the required training component.<br/> <br/>

                    <strong>Review</strong>
                    <p>
                        Positive significant financial interest disclosure forms shall be promptly reviewed by the Research Integrity (RI)
                        office once forwarded from Sponsored Programs. Designated RI staff will coordinate with the FCOIC Chair for the
                        purpose of determining if a relevant significant financial interest is disclosed. If the review of the disclosure
                        statement reveals that NO relevant significant financial interest exists, the disclosure statement shall immediately
                        be forwarded to Sponsored Programs and no further action is required. <br/> <br/>
                        If the review of the disclosure statement reveals that an actual or perceived significant financial interest does
                        exist, the following actions must be completed prior to expenditure of any funds under the award, prior to approval
                        by the IRB and / or prior to the submission of intellectual property for registration:
                    </p>

                        <li>

                                    The FCOIC Chair shall consult with the investigator(s) and the parties shall jointly review the disclosure statement. If
                                    a potential or actual conflict of interest is eliminated by agreement of the parties (e.g. through the divestiture of
                                    interest, severance of relationships), the FCOIC Chair will provide written detailed confirmation of the agreement of
                                    the parties to the VPR and forward the disclosure statement to Sponsored Programs. No further action is required.

                                    If elimination of the conflict or potential conflict is not possible, the FCOI committee shall develop a course of
                                    action to manage or reasonably reduce the conflict. The Division of Research may also be consulted for guidance and
                                    development of the management plan. The FCOIC Chair, and / or full committee, shall review and approve, or reject, the
                                    management plan proposed. For research involving human subjects, special attention must be paid to assure that the plan
                                    is designed so that the financial interest does not alter the risk to or welfare of research participants.

                                        The FCOIC shall review all material provided. The FCOIC can recommend, and the VPR impose, conditions or
                                        restrictions on investigators in formulating courses of action designed to deal with potential or actual conflict of
                                        interest. Such restrictions include, but are not limited to: public disclosure of significant financial interests,
                                        independent reviewer monitoring of the research, modifications of the management plan, disqualifications of members
                                        from participation in all or portions of the research, divestiture of the significant financial interest and/or
                                        severance of relationships creating the actual or potential conflict of interest.
                                        The FCOIC may conclude that the potential or actual conflict is sufficiently remote or unrelated to the research or
                                        intellectual property so that no action, other than the disclosure and annual reporting requirements, is required

                                            The plan recommended by the FCOIC and accepted by the VPR shall require an annual reporting from the investigator to the
                                            FCOIC with a final end of project report. The annual report to the FCOIC must include the status of the management plan,
                                            explaining whether the financial conflict is still being managed or why the financial conflict no longer exists and a
                                            description of any changes to the management plan since the last FCOI report was submitted. Reports shall be submitted
                                            to the FCOIC and the investigator must document the actions taken to implement the conditions outlined in the plan.

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
