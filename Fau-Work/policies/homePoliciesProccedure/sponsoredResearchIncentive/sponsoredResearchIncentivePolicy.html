					<h3> I. Background</h3>
					<div id="paragraph">
						<p>Externally sponsored academic activity involving university faculty, whether teaching, research, or
                            service, is presumed to satisfy the academic needs of the university and the academically related
                            objectives of the sponsoring agency. The university provides faculty and facilities while the sponsor
                            provides funds for the activities. Because faculty time and effort are required, it is reasonable for
                            the university to request funds from the sponsor to support faculty effort. Whenever possible, it is
                            prudent for the university to dedicate released state funds in ways that enhance its academic
                            activities.

					<h3>II. Purpose</h3> 
					<div id="paragraph">
						<p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The purpose of the Sponsored Research Incentive Policy is to reward faculty for sustained
                            externally funded productivity and scholarly activities. This policy will stimulate scholarly activity
                            associated with performing externally funded research in all units. Faculty who are effective in
                            securing extramural funds while maintaining their other scholarly responsibilities are eligible for
                            the incentive. <br/>
                            The Sponsored Research Incentive Policy can also be utilized as a recruitment tool and to retain
                            highly productive faculty.

				<h3>III. General Statement</h3>
				<div id="paragraph">
					<p>When appropriate, sponsoring agencies that have objectives compatible with FAU’s academic
                        enterprise may provide funds to support faculty time and effort. Such funds are substituted for
                        state funds that have been dedicated to faculty members’ base salaries. <br/>
                        The State funds released may be used to create an incentive pool within each college to further its
                        academic activities by providing incentive funds.

                    <h3>I. INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITION OF EXTERNAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT</h3>
                    <p>
                            It is assumed that externally sponsored academic activity, whether research, teaching, or service,
                            involving University faculty satisfies the scholarly needs of the University and the objectives of the
                            sponsoring agency. The University provides faculty and facilities; while the sponsor funds research and
                            scholarly activities. Because faculty time and effort are required, it is reasonable for the University to
                            request funds from the sponsor to support faculty effort. Whenever possible, it is prudent for the
                            University to dedicate those funds to the enhancement of academic activities. To this end, an incentive
                            pool can be created from state funds released when a faculty activity is funded by a grant or contract.
                            This incentive pool may be used to provide funds to support travel, equipment, faculty salary
                            enhancements, graduate student support, and other activities that enhance the academic mission. <br/>
                            External support in that context refers to financial support not derived from FAU state-budgeted
                            sources. Academic activity incentive consideration will be given to programs of high quality that are
                            compatible with the objectives of the Departments, the College and the Institute, regardless of the
                            funding source. As always, programs funded by federal, state or private sources must receive the
                            approval of the Department Chair, and the Dean, prior to being initiated.

                            in their notice of appointment and as allowable by the sponsoring agency consistent with their time
                            commitment to conduct the proposed academic activity.

                    <h3>III. PROCEDURES FOR DISTRIBUTION OF ACADEMIC ACTIVITY INCENTIVE FUNDS</h3>
                    <p>
                            While the principles outlined in this document can be used to promote and reward externally sponsored
                            academic activity, a case-by-case discussion with the Dean and the Department Chair is required to
                            ensure that the academic obligations of each faculty member are not compromised. The Department
                            Chair, in cooperation with the Office of the Dean, is responsible for maintaining quality instruction and
                            service within the Department. In all such discussions, the concept of “Released Time” will supersede
                            the concept of academic activity incentive. <br/>
                            “Released Time” refers to that portion of the normal teaching or service commitment of a faculty
                            member that he/she “buys”, subject to the approval of the Dean, from the Department with external
                            funds so that he/she can engage in research/scholarship. The Department may request approval from
                            the Dean to keep a portion of the recovered state appropriated funds to hire temporary help to cover
                            the released commitments. <br/>
                            As discussed below, the Academic Activity Incentive concept pertains strictly to that part of a faculty
                            member’s time committed for the academic activity out of the time he/she is paid to perform work as
                            part of the academic year appointment as outlined in the notice of appointment each year. The faculty
                            member still performs the other normal obligations in teaching, research, and service during the
                            academic year.
                            <ol type="A">
                                <li>Any state-funded FAU faculty member will have access to seventy- five percent (75%) of state funds
                                    recovered in association with his/her participation in an externally funded academic activity.
                                </li>

                                        These funds may be used to support travel, equipment, graduate students, faculty salary
                                        enhancements, or other activities that enhance the academic mission. The amount that may be
                                        allocated as a salary enhancement may not exceed twenty percent (25%) of the faculty member’s
                                        academic year base salary. <br/>
                                        <strong>NOTE: The receipt of incentive salary does not alter the base salary of a faculty member.</strong>

                                <li>
                                        Because a minimum of seventy five percent (75%) of incentive income each year is available to
                                        specific faculty, the remaining twenty five percent (25%) may be used to otherwise foster academic
                                        activity. Recommendations for use of fifteen percent (15%) will be initiated by the Department
                                        Chair and approved by the Dean. The remaining ten percent (10%) will be used at the discretion of
                                        the Dean.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                        Incentive allocations will be distributed twice each year and will be based upon funds generated
                                        from the current year’s grant activities. If applicable, each year a separate academic activity
                                        incentive agreement must be drafted by the faculty member requesting participation in this
                                        program. The request must include a copy of the individual’s notice of appointment, which
                                        provides their base salary. Neither academic incentive nor lack of it will affect the regular base
                                        salary figure. The agreement will call for two incentive payments each year as long as the individual
                                        is on the payroll at both times in a given year. The funds will be distributed at the end of each
                                        semester during the academic year (December and May) and will represent the funds released for
                                        that semester.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                        For funded grants/contracts originating within the Faculty member's College, all of the grantrecovered State personnel dollars associated with an “outside” faculty member’s participation
                                        would go to that College’s or Institute’s incentive pool. That is, the other College or Institute would
                                        have the funds to provide incentive in the current year’s contract and would have any remainder to
                                        support research and scholarship as recommended by their Department Chair and/or Dean. <br/>
                                        Similarly, for a project involving a faculty member within the College or Institute, but originating in
                                        another College or Institute, recovered funds for the faculty will go into the academic activity
                                        incentive pool for the Faculty member's College or Institute and distributed per this policy. It is the
                                        faculty member’s responsibility to make arrangements for this to occur, in advance of the salary
                                        funding distribution change.
                                </li>

                                Comment: This approach would eliminate involvement in contract negotiations and related salary
                                matters with faculty outside of the College or Institute. It maintains Departmental and College authority
                                relationships and gives additional incentives to Department Chairs and Deans to have their faculty
                                cooperate across disciplines.

                      <h3>I. INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITION OF EXTERNAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT</h3>
                       <p>
                            It is assumed that externally sponsored academic activity, whether research, teaching, or service,
                            involving University faculty satisfies the scholarly needs of the University and the objectives of the
                            sponsoring agency. The University provides faculty and facilities; while the sponsor funds research and
                            scholarly activities. Because faculty time and effort are required, it is reasonable for the University to
                            request funds from the sponsor to support faculty effort. Whenever possible, it is prudent for the
                            University to dedicate those funds to the enhancement of academic activities. To this end, an incentive
                            pool can be created from state funds released when a faculty activity is funded by a grant or contract.
                            This incentive pool may be used to provide funds to support travel, equipment, faculty salary
                            enhancements, graduate student support, and other activities that enhance the academic mission. <br/>
                            External support in that context refers to financial support not derived from state budgeted sources.
                            Academic activity incentive consideration will be given to programs of high quality that are compatible
                            with the objectives of the Departments and the College, regardless of the funding source. As always,
                            programs funded by federal, state or private sources must receive the approval of the Department
                            Chair, the Dean and the Provost, prior to being initiated.

                            All state-funded faculty members who apply for externally funded grants or contracts should request
                            funding to support a percentage of their total twelve-month salaries as outlined in their notice of
                            appointment and as allowable by the sponsoring agency, including fringe benefits, consistent with their

                            the concept of academic activity incentive. <br/>
                            “Released Time” refers to that portion of the normal teaching or service commitment of a faculty
                            member that he/she “buys out”, subject to the approval of the Dean, from the Department with
                            external funds so that he/she can engage in research/scholarship. The Department may request
                            approval from the Dean to keep a portion of the recovered state appropriated funds to hire temporary
                            help to cover the released commitments. Release time is normally associated with 9-month
                            appointments and may not be a factor in 12-month appointments where faculty may have a significant
                            fraction of their effort dedicated to research (e.g., 70% of their effort is dedicated to research and
                            teaching obligations have fewer contact hours than a 9-momth appointment). <br/>
                            As discussed below, the Academic Activity Incentive concept pertains strictly to that part of a faculty
                            member’s time committed for the academic activity out of the time he/she is paid to perform work as

                            faculty member still performs his/her other normal obligations in teaching, research, and service during
                            the academic year.

                                    12-month research-intensive faculty are required to fund a percentage of their annual salary from
                                    research grants (typically 25% or 50%, depending upon the unit). Funding this portion of their salary

                                    Incentive allocations will be distributed twice each year and will be based upon funds generated
                                    from the current year’s grant activities. If applicable, each year a separate academic activity
                                    incentive agreement must be drafted by the faculty member requesting participation in this
                                    program. The request must include a copy of the individual’s notice of appointment, which provides
                                    their base salary. Neither academic incentive nor lack of it will affect the regular base salary figure.
                                    The agreement will call for two incentive payments each year as long as the individual is on the
                                    payroll at both times in a given year. The funds will be distributed at the end of each semester
                                    during the academic year (December and May) and will represent the funds released for that
                                    semester.

                                    For funded grants/contracts originating within the Faculty member's College, all of the grantrecovered State personnel dollars associated with an “outside” faculty member’s participation
                                    would go to that College’s or Institute’s incentive pool. That is, the other College or Institute would
                                    have the funds to provide incentive in the current year’s contract and would have any remainder to
                                    support research and scholarship as recommended by their Department Chair and/or Dean. <br/>
                                    Similarly, for a project involving a faculty member within the College or Institute, but originating in
                                    another College or Institute, recovered funds for the faculty will go into the academic activity
                                    incentive pool for the Faculty member's College or Institute and distributed per this policy. It is the
                                    faculty member’s responsibility to make arrangements for this to occur, in advance of the salary
                                    funding distribution change. <br/> Comment: This approach would eliminate involvement in contract negotiations and related salary
                                    matters with faculty outside of the College or Institute. It maintains Departmental and College authority
                                    relationships and gives additional incentives to Department Chairs and Deans to have their faculty
                                    cooperate across disciplines.

                                    Quality research and scholarship are emphasized. As previously mentioned, seventy-five percent (75%)
                                    of individual external sponsored academic activity incentive is available to a faculty member. Of this
                                    amount up to twenty percent (25%) of the base salary for a given academic year may be provided for
                                    faculty salary enhancement.

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
