                                    They provide access to technology, equipment, services, and training that are not typically
                                    affordable by a single researcher and are valuable to multiple investigators. Research Cores are
                                    defined by operational and financial independence, specifically:</span>

                                <p>Formal oversight of Research Cores lies within the Office of the Vice President for Research.</p>
                                <strong>Research Core Oversight Committee:</strong>
                                <p>
                                        The Research Core Oversight Committee consists of up to 15 members, comprising
                                        representatives from all relevant campuses, including core users, core directors and
                                        administrators. The committee is chaired by the Associate Vice President (or designee) in the
                                        Division of Research (DOR). The Oversight Committee develops and manages the
                                        infrastructure necessary for the research cores to operate, including operational guidelines,
                                        financial mechanisms and other relevant guidelines. <br/>The committee advises the VPR on the following:
                                       
                                </p>

                                        termination</li>
                                    <li>annual review and approval of rate structure</li>
                                    <li>review of annual reports, and changes to or termination of core operations</li>

                                <strong>Core Director Council:</strong>
                                <p>The Core Director Council consists of core directors representing the individual cores at all
                                        campuses of the University. The Council will meet quarterly, or more often, as needed, to
                                        discuss core operations and share best practices. The Council is convened by the DOR

                                <h3>FINANCING OF CORES AND INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT</h3>
                                <p>
                                        Cores must develop a sustainable business plan. A balanced budget can be achieved through,
                                        for example, fees-for-service, support from grants (e.g. NIH infrastructure support grants, P30),
                                        institute funds, departmental funds, or special agreements (where applicable). <br/>In some cases, institutional funds may be required to support a research core. User affiliations
                                        will determine the institutional unit providing support. As such, a research core that is routinely
                                        used by faculty from more than one unit may be subsidized/supported by the central
                                        administration. Research cores that serve faculty from a single college or department may be
                                        supported by the corresponding unit. <br/>In order to receive institutional support for operations (“subsidy”), a research core must at least
                                        demonstrate the presence of:

                                <h3>PROCEDURE TO ESTABLISH A NEW RESEARCH CORE</h3>
                                <p>The steps to establish a research core are:</p>

                                    <li>
                                            Prepare a mission statement (purpose of the research core, and how it aligns
                                            with the University’s academic and research missions)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            Establish an Advisory Committee, including at least one member outside of the
                                            department/institute, and including the core director
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            Prepare an annual operational budget, including space requirements, salaries,
                                            operating costs, depreciation of equipment (see Appendix 2 and template)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            Estimate the number of users and/or units of service to be provided in a fiscal
                                            year

                                            Develop a rate per unit of service, following this model:
                                            Rate/Unit Service = Annual Budget/Estimated Annual Units Service
                                            Also, include difference in internal rate vs. external rate (see Appendix 2 and
                                            template)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            Prepare a market analysis, i.e. compare research core rates to other vendors
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            Prepare a business plan and request to establish a new core and forward to
                                            DOR for approval by the Oversight Committee and Budget &amp; Auxiliary Committee
                                            (see Appendix 1 and 2; rate template)

                                <strong>Appeal process </strong>
                                <p>In the event that a proposed research core is denied approval, an appeal may be made, within
                                        30 days, to the VPR. Appeals should include the letter indicating a denial.</p>

                                        encouraged by federal funding agencies. Charges to external users must be reasonable and
                                        appropriately established in compliance with federal regulations. Proposed rates for external
                                        users are to be included with new research core business plan and application.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>All rates should be developed to comply with all university, state, and federal guidelines</li>
                    <strong>Direct Costs</strong>
                    <li>Costs for activities or services that benefit specific projects, e.g., salaries for project staff
                            and materials required for a particular project</li>
                    <li>Because these activities are easily traced to projects, their costs are usually charged to
                            projects on an item-by-item basis. </li>
                    <strong>Indirect Costs (F&amp;A)</strong>
                    <li>Costs for activities or services that benefit more than one project. </li>
                    <li>Their precise benefits to a specific project are often difficult or impossible to trace.</li>
                    <li>Indirect costs do not vary substantially within certain production volumes or other
                            indicators of activity, and so are considered to be fixed costs. </li>

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
