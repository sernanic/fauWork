                    <p>
                            FAU’s Division of Research has contracted University MRI Diagnostic Imaging Centers (UMRI)
                            to provide FAU Principal Investigators access to a General Electric Signa HDXT (TwinSpeed)
                            3T MRI scanner. Access to UMRI is managed by FAU to assure compliance with established
                            policies for the protection and welfare of human subjects participating in research, manage
                            contractual obligations, and recover charges for services.

                            The purpose of this policy is to establish uniform procedures to provide access to the UMRI 3T
                            scanner.

                            <p>Expedited review may be requested, e.g., if the study protocol requires the recruitment

                                        Chair) within 30 days of application receipt. If an application is denied, the committee will
                                        provide applicant with additional explanation regarding application denial.</li>

                                        participation would constitute a conflict of interest or cause the appearance of a conflict
                                        of interest. A member with an application under consideration by the committee may be
                                        present to answer questions from the other members, however they must be excused
                                        when their application is being evaluated and voted upon. In addition, members are
                                        strongly cautioned to be especially sensitive in avoiding conflict of interest situations, or
                                        the appearance of a conflict, to protect their own, their Department’s and the University’s
                                        reputation. This includes projects from the member’s own department, if the member has
                                        more than a casual interest in the project.</li>

                                        vote after proper motions have been made, seconded and discussed. Minutes will be

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
