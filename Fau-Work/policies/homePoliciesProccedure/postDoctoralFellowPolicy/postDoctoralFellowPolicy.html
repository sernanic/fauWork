                         <strong>BACKGROUND</strong> <br/>
                        The role of the Postdoctoral Fellow is crucial to the success of Florida Atlantic University (FAU) research programs.
                        Postdoctoral Fellows have been hired into FAU through multiple Human Resources categories including faculty and Other
                        Personnel Services (OPS). This policy will establish a new hiring category specifically for Postdoctoral Fellows
                        outlining the job definition, time-length of appointment, benefits, and performance evaluation inherent in this
                        position. <br/><br/>
                        Existing Postdoctoral Fellows hired in OPS positions will be transitioned into this new category effective July 28,
                        2018. Existing Postdoctoral Fellows hired in faculty positions will remain in that position for no longer than six (6)
                        years from their start date in that position.<br/><br/>
                        All new Postdoctoral Fellows hired effective July 28, 2018 and forward will be employed using the Postdoctoral Fellows
                        position category with conditions and provisions outlined in this policy.

                         <strong>PURPOSE</strong> <br/>
                        This policy is designed to assist the University in its efforts to define the position of a Postdoctoral Fellow and to
                        report the number of employees holding this position as FAU increases its research programs.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p> <strong>POLICY</strong> <br/>
                    The following provides the definition of a Postdoctoral Fellow, the position hiring and appointment details, eligible
                    benefits, and annual performance evaluation process.
                     <i>Definition of a Postdoctoral Fellow</i><br/>
                    We are following the guidelines established by the NIH, NSF and NPA:
                    A postdoctoral scholar ("postdoc") is an individual holding a doctoral degree who is engaged in a temporary period of
                    mentored research and/or scholarly training for the purpose of acquiring or enhancing the professional skills needed to
                    pursue a career path of his or her choosing.<br/><br/>
                     <i>Hiring / Appointment</i><br/>
                    The appointment of a postdoctoral fellow is typically a 12-month assignment, limited to three years, with the option to
                    extend by up to three additional years to a total of six (6) years. Upon the end date the appointee will have no
                    continued contractual relationship with the University.<br/><br/>
                    If the postdoctoral fellow shows unusual independence in their research, the option to assign space in the last three
                    years of the assignment exists and is up to the discretion of the supervisor. Such space assignment should be primarily
                    used and be assigned with the understanding that extramural, federal grant applications with the postdoctoral fellow as
                    PI will be submitted.<br/><br/>
                    The hiring of Postdoctoral Fellows is exempt from the FAU recruitment process due to their special research expertise
                    that typically has to align with that of the research advisor and time- limited appointment. Hiring and employment is
                    subject to all federal and state laws, in addition to university regulations, including but not limited to the
                    University Intellectual Property Policy, Policy on Faculty Conflict of Commitment and Conflict of Interest, Policy on
                    Integrity in Research and Procedures for Reviewing Alleged Misconduct, Policy on Employment of Relatives and the Annual
                    Leave Policy for Contract and Grant Employees. Postdoctoral research appointees must also comply with the
                    recommendations and requirements of the Universityâ€™s compliance committees (IRB, IACUC, Research Safety, etc.).<br/><br/>
                    All FAU employees must be able to work in the United States and any Postdoctoral Fellow requiring a visa to work should
                    seek guidance from International Services https://www.fau.edu/international/ to verify the appropriate visa status is
                    maintained while at FAU. The salary and duties of a postdoctoral fellow must meet the minimum level for an exempt
                    employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act and any policies of Florida Atlantic University.
                    The offer letter to be used can be found here that contains pertinent employment conditions:
                    http://www.fau.edu/research/postdoc-affairs/index.php. The Vice President for Research is to be copied on all
                    Postdoctoral Fellow Offer Letters.<br/><br/>
                     <i>Orientation</i> <br/>
                    Due to Postdoctoral Fellows being hired continually, please verify with Human Resources the orientation date. The
                    Division of Research will sponsor Welcome Receptions periodically throughout the year.<br/><br/>
                     <i>Benefits</i> <br/>
                    Postdoctoral Fellows are eligible for specific benefits including:

                        of their appointment, postdocs and their advisor should fill out an Independent Development Plan (IDP). This form should
                        then be used to annually evaluate progress. Supervisors should use the evaluation form found here:
                        <a href="http://www.fau.edu/research/postdoc-affairs/index.php">http://www.fau.edu/research/postdoc-affairs/index.php</a> and once completed, post the evaluation to the documents section

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
