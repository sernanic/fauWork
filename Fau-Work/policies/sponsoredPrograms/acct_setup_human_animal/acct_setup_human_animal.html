            <li><h2><u>Background</u></h2>
                Engaging in human subject research without Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval or engaging in animal subject
                research without Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval not only violates federal regulatory
                policy but can also have serious ethical implications for the researcher. Faculty, staff and students are required
                to submit IRB or IACUC approval prior to initiating any data collection.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2><u>Policy</u></h2>
                It is the policy of Florida Atlantic University that all sponsored research that involves human or animal subjects have
                IRB or IACUC approval on file prior to a grant account being initiated. The Universityâ€™s policy states that
                non-compliance may result in, among other things, suspension or termination of the study; and/or suspension of research
                privileges at the University. <br/> <br/>
                Faculty and Staff are advised that actions could include, but are not limited to:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Division of Research will not initiate grant accounts for projects lacking
                    necessary IRB or IACUC approvals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Funding may be withheld: Federal sponsors, and most private sponsors, require IRB or IACUC approvals as a condition of
                    an award. Sponsors may postpone review of proposals or initiation of a grant award notification if proof of committee
                    approval cannot be provided to them on request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An IRB fee is charged for industry-funded human subjects research.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Journal articles cannot be published without the appropriate committee
                    approval. Most professional journals require evidence of IRB or IACUC
                    approval when considering articles for publication.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    The University does not support research conducted without the appropriate
                    compliance committee approval. Data secured before such approval may be
                    disapproved for use by the IRB or IACUC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The University has the authority to suspend all research activities for a
                    specified time frame as a disciplinary measure.
                </li>
                <p>
                    Grant accounts may be initiated for projects that include research with animals or human subjects when the following are
                    applicable:
                </p>
                <li>When a substantive, scientifically justified request is submitted by the PI,</li>
                <li>
                    and / or when an IRB/IACUC protocol has been submitted and is already
                    under committee review
                </li>
                <li>
                    and the PI provides written assurance that no animal or human subjects
                    research will be initiated without the appropriate protocol approvals having
                    been secured.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                    For example, grant accounts may be initiated ahead of final protocol approval for the purpose of equipment purchase,
                    payroll or other justifiable expense. The Principal Investigator must submit the request to the Director, Research
                    Integrity and Director, Sponsored Programs for review. (See Exhibit A - Request for Grant Account on Projects Involving
                    Animal or Human Subjects). * In certain circumstances, granting of such an exception will be contingent upon the
                    approval from the Vice President for Research. <br/> <br/>
                    <i>
                        Liability issues arising from unapproved research become the responsibility of the investigator. Persons conducting
                        unapproved research are deemed to be acting outside the scope of authority granted to them by the University. The
                        University may not, therefore, provide an investigator of an unapproved project the resources to answer a liability
                        complaint.

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every
            student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new
            revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public
            university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one,
            FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen,
            transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast
            Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree
            programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural
            and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
