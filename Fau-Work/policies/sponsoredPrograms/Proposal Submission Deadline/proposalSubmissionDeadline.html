                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>In August 2012, due to the increased number of last minute proposal submissions to the Office
                            of Sponsored
                            Programs (OSP) it became necessary for the Division of Research to adopt the Proposal
                            Submission Deadline
                            Policy. Implementation of this policy ensured a timely review and successful submission to
                            the sponsor. The
                            policy provides the Proposal and Contract Administrator (PCA) in the Office of Sponsored
                            Programs sufficient
                            time to ensure that the sponsor&rsquo;s guidelines are met, the budget and budget
                            justification are correct,
                            compliance requirements have been adhered to, and the proposal is submitted on time.</p>
                    </li>

                        <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        <p>The purpose of the Proposal Submission Deadline Policy is to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                        <h2>General Statement</h2>
                        <p>FAU is committed to the pursuit of increasing the research enterprise. One sure way this can
                            occur is by the
                            submission of excellent proposals to external funding agencies. OSP will assist faculty and
                            provide maximum
                            level of customer service to ensure proposal review and submission go according to plan.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Policy</h2>
                        <p>All proposals submitted to external sponsors must be completed and routed electronically via
                            FAU&rsquo;s
                            electronic research administration system no later than <strong>five (5) business days

                                established sponsor or submission deadline, whichever is sooner</strong>. For example,
                            if the
                            sponsor/submission deadline is 5:00pm on Friday, the OSP deadline is 8:00am the previous

                        <p>In order for the proposal to be considered on-time, the proposal must be complete, in final
                            form, and
                            approved by the Chair and/or Dean&rsquo;s Office.</p>

                    <p>The role of the authorized approver in the college/institute is crucial during the review and
                        approval process for
                        proposals. It is recommended that faculty stay in close communication with their college/institute
                        during proposal
                        preparation and submission.</p>
                    <p>Individual colleges/institutes may require additional time to sufficiently review and approve
                        proposals prior to
                        submitting to OSP. Consult with your Dean&rsquo;s Office regarding internal deadline requirements
                        for your college.
                    </p>
                    <p>When submitting a proposal that involves faculty from multiple colleges/institutes, the authorized
                        approver(s) for
                        each college/institute must also review and approve the proposal. Allow sufficient time for</p>
                    <p>each authorized approver(s) to review and approve the proposal. It is recommended that the business
                        managers or
                        equivalent from each college/institute be notified as early in the process and given head&rsquo;s up
                        about the
                        proposal submission.</p>
                    <p> <u>Policy Exception Request</u> </p>
                    <strong>The Office of Sponsored Programs has eliminated the Exception Request from this policy. A request
                        for an exception
                        of the Proposal Submission Policy is no longer needed when a proposal does not meet the 5-business
                        day deadline.
                        Instead, we are adopting the following proposal review procedures.</strong>

                                will receive a full review and will have priority status. Proposals submitted with less than

                                business days will receive a limited review or no review depending on when it is received in
                                OSP and the
                                current workload of the assigned PCA.</p>

                                because they
                                arrived late. Proposal review priority is given to those proposals that meet the Proposal

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first
            public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only.
            Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves
            more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region
            in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from
            more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community
            engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
