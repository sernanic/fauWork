        <p> <strong><u>BACKGROUND</u></strong> </p>
        <p>Sponsors may require that applicants submit a pre-proposal (aka, Letters of Intent, White Papers, Concept
            Papers, and Pre-Applications) for review prior to a full proposal. The pre- proposal typically includes a
            brief summary of the project, list of personnel, and budget amount. If selected, the Principal Investigator
            would then submit a more formal or full proposal.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> <strong><u>PURPOSE</u></strong> </p>
        <p>To establish a uniform policy, to expedite the pre-proposal submission process, and to provide guidance to
            faculty and staff regarding the submission of pre-proposals (aka Letters of Intent, White Papers, Concept
            Papers, and Pre-Applications) to sponsoring agencies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> <strong><u>GENERAL STATEMENT</u></strong> </p>
        <p>FAU is committed to the pursuit of increasing the research enterprise. One way this occurs is through the
            submission of pre-proposals to external funding agencies. This policy allows faculty to submit pre-proposals
            as expeditiously as possible to solicit interest in their respective research programs. This policy
            identifies when pre-proposals require review and approval of the Office of Sponsored Programs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> <strong><u>POLICY</u></strong> </p>
        <p>When a sponsor requires the submission of a pre-proposal, the Principal Investigator (PI) may need to submit
            the pre-proposal through the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) proposal routing system for review and
            approval.</p>
        <p> <strong> <mark style="background-color: gray">Pre-Proposals Routed for Review and Approval through Sponsored Programs</mark> </strong> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Pre-proposals must be submitted to the Office of Sponsored Programs, through the proposal routing
                    system, for review and approval when <u><strong>any</strong></u> of the following are required:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        <p>The pre-proposal includes a detailed line-item budget that cannot be altered when submitting
                            the full proposal, <strong>or</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The pre-proposal includes FAU cost-sharing/matching and requires a firm commitment be
                            included in the pre-proposal.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> <strong>Pre-Proposal Submission Deadline</strong> </p>
                <p>Pre-proposals will follow the Proposal Submission Deadline Policy (No. 10.2.10) which states:</p> <br/>
                <p>All proposals must be received via the proposal routing system used by Sponsored Programs no later than five (5)
                business days before the sponsor&rsquo;s deadline. For instance, if the sponsor&rsquo;s deadline is 5:00pm on
                Friday, the Sponsored Programs deadline is 8:00am the previous Monday.</p>
                <p> <mark style="background-color: gray"> <strong>Pre-Proposals Submitted to Sponsor without Submission through Sponsored Programs</strong> </mark></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pre-proposals that do <strong>not </strong>require <u><strong>any</strong></u> of the items listed under
                            number 1 above, may be submitted to the sponsor without going through OSP&rsquo;s proposal routing system.
                            When submitting the pre-proposal to the sponsor via e-mail, the PI should copy the appropriate Proposal and
                            Contract Administrator (PCA). If submission is not through email, a copy of the pre-proposal should be
                            emailed to the PCA, after it has been submitted to the sponsor.</p>
                        <p>For the pre-proposals submitted without Sponsored Programs review and approval, it is recommended that the PI
                            check with their department/unit to verify their process prior to submitting the pre-proposal to the
                            sponsor.</p>

                                <p>It is the PI&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that the pre-proposal budget includes F&amp;A.
                                    PI&rsquo;s must include the FAU Federal Negotiated Rate in pre-proposals unless the solicitation
                                    states differently. Any deviation from charging the appropriate rate must have prior approval of the
                                    Director of Sponsored Programs.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>If the appropriate F&amp;A rate is not included in the pre-proposal budget, the Office of Sponsored
                                    Programs will include the F&amp;A at full proposal submission, even if it affects and lowers the
                                    total direct costs for the project.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Only the Director of Sponsored Programs or the Vice President for Research are authorized to
                                    negotiate the F&amp;A rate. Any negotiations done by the PI or anyone besides those authorized will
                                    not be honored and may result in the full proposal not being submitted to the sponsor.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

<p> <strong>Limited Number of Pre-Proposals</strong> </p>
<p>If the Program Announcement (PA) or Request for Proposal (RFP) limits the number of pre- proposal submissions from an
    institution, the PI is required to contact the Division of Research
    (DOR) at<a href="mailto:limited@fau.edu" target="_blank">limited@fau.edu </a> and indicate their interest.</p>
<p>DOR will review the guidelines and arrange an appropriate internal review process, as applicable. This selection
    process could take several weeks. Submit early and allow ample time for this process.</p>
<p>Policy Review: The Pre-Proposal Submission Policy will be updated as necessary.</p>

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
