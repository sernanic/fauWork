            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with
            every
            student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the
            University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new
            revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public
            university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since
            day one,
            FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000
            freshmen,
            transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast
            Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170
            degree
            programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of
            cultural
            and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
