            <li>
                <p>Background</p>
                <p>Florida Atlantic University is required to comply with revisions of budget and program plans in accordance
                    with 2 CFR, Part 215 (formerly OMB Circular A-110), 2 CFR, Part 220 (formerly OMB A-21), OMB A-133, and
                    agency specific policies and award terms.</p>
            </li>
            <hr/>
            <li>
                <p>Purpose</p>
                <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish uniform procedures for identifying and reporting deviations from
                    the proposed budget on sponsored projects in accordance with 2 CFR, Part 215, 2 CFR, Part 220, OMB A-133 and
                    agency specific policies and award terms.</p>
            </li>
            <hr/>
            <li>
                <p>General Statement</p>
                <p>The Division of Research is available to answer questions and provide assistance regarding the requirements
                    of the Budget Revisions Policy.</p>
            </li>
            <hr/>
            <li>
                <p>Policy</p>
                <p>Florida Atlantic University is required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior
                    approvals for budget revisions.</p>
                <p>The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process.
                    Most agencies will allow the university to depart from the original budget provided that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>expenditures are necessary for the successful completion of the project,</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>expenditures are allowable under the governing cost principles and agency specific policies, and</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>prior approval is obtained when required.</p>
                        <p>Budget revisions are not allowed for the purpose of relieving financial pressure on a
                            department&rsquo;s unrestricted budget, or on other sponsored projects in order to charge costs that
                            are not necessary for the completion of the project, or not allowable.</p>
                        <p>The University requires prior written sponsor approval for budget revisions to buy equipment within
                            90 days of project end date.</p>
                        <p>Prior approval requirements for the various sponsoring agencies are subject to change; the principal
                            investigator should contact Sponsored Programs for guidance. When requesting prior approval for
                            budget revisions, the Principal Investigator must submit the budget forms that were used in the
                            application unless the Federal or Non Federal awarding agency indicates that a letter suffices,
                            following agency procedures.</p>
                        <p>Budget revisions will be allowed upon sponsor approval. Failure to obtain prior approval from the
                            sponsoring agency for any budget revisions requiring such approval may result in the disallowance of
                            costs.</p>
                        <p>If the sponsor requires approval, then the principal investigator must draft the letter to the agency
                            and forward the letter to Sponsored Programs for countersignature by the official of the University
                        </p>
                        <h3>Federal Awards</h3>
                        <h4>The University will request prior approval from Federal awarding agencies for one or more of the
                            following program or budget related reasons.</h4>

                        <h4>NON FEDERAL AWARDS</h4>
                        <p>The University will refer to the sponsored agreements to determine if budget revisions are allowed
                            and require prior approval.</p>
                    </li>

                <p>Definitions</p>
                <p>Allocable        A cost is allocable to a project if goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable in
                    accordance with the relative benefits received by the projects. In order to be allocable a cost must be
                    treated consistently in like circumstances.</p>
                <p>Allowable         A cost is allowable to a project if: (1) the costs are reasonable; (2) the costs are allocable to
                    the specific project; (3) the costs are treated consistently in like circumstances; and (4) the costs
                    conform to any limitations of the cost principles or the sponsored agreement.</p>
                <p>Budget Revision       Budget adjustments are to reallocate funds from one budget pool to another to reflect the
                    requirements of the project.</p>
                <p>2 CFR, Part 220       Established principles for determining costs applicable to grants, contracts, and other
                    agreements with educational institutions.</p>
                <p>2 CFR, Part 215       Standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies in the
                    administration of grants to and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other
                    non-profit organizations.</p>
                <p>OMB Circular A-133        Standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of
                    states, local governments, and non profit organizations expending Federal awards.</p>
                <p>Reasonable        A cost may be considered reasonable if the nature of the goods or services acquired or applied,
                    and the amount involved therefore, reflect the action that a prudent person would have taken under the
                    circumstances prevailing at the time the decision to incur the cost was made.</p>
                <p>Significant Rebudgeting       A threshold that is reached when expenditures in a single direct cost budget category
                    change (increase or decrease) from the categorical commitment level established for the budget period by
                    more than 25 percent of the total costs awarded. Significant rebudgeting is likely to be considered a change
                    in scope.</p>

                    allowable costs in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award. Questions of a procedural nature
                    should be addressed to Sponsored Programs <u>before</u> budget revisions and online transfers are submitted.
                    Specific questions may be referred to the appropriate official listed in the award document. If prior
                    approval is required, principal investigators must obtain written approval from the sponsoring agency prior
                    to submitting Budget Revision Request Form and electronic Budget Transfer Form.</p>

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
