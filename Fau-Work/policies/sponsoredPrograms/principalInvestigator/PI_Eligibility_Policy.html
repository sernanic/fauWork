                <u><h2>BACKGROUND</h2></u>
                <p>
                    When Florida Atlantic University (FAU) submits proposals to external sponsors and accepts awards for sponsored projects,
                    the university assumes significant financial and legal obligations. Sponsors fund projects based on the professional
                    expertise of the Principal Investigators submitting proposals; however, the formal award is in the name of Florida
                    Atlantic University Board of Trustees. FAU has similar responsibility pertaining to the submission of compliance
                    protocols for all projects.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><u><h2>PURPOSE</h2></u>
                <p>
                        To establish a policy that will provide guidance to all members of the university community, to include all students,
                        faculty, and staff seeking Principal Investigator or Co-Principal Investigator status.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <u><h2>GENERAL STATEMENT</h2></u>
                <p>
                        Under the general oversight and authority of Florida Atlantic University, the Principal Investigator is the individual
                        who bears primary responsibility for technical compliance, completion of programmatic work, fiscal stewardship of
                        sponsor funds, and compliance with administrative requirements of the project. Thus, the University must ensure that
                        individuals serving in the capacity of Principal Investigator have the technical competence and administrative
                        capabilities to carry out all projects.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <u><h2>POLICY</h2></u>
                <p>

                        Investigator (PI) and a Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) on all projects at Florida Atlantic University. <br/> <br/>

Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree, every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later, the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU. Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds of cultural and educational events every year. <br /><br /><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
