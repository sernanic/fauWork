                                                            Florida Atlantic University (FAU) has a long history of successful collaboration with foreign research organizations and
                                                            supports and encourages international research, collaboration, and scholarship, which contribute to the mission of the
                                                            University.<br/><br/>
                                                            In recent months, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other U.S. federal agencies, (NSF, DOD, and DOE) that
                                                            support university research have demonstrated concern over foreign influence and have issued guidance to universities to
                                                            ensure transparency on financial support received from all foreign entities.<br/><br/>
                                                            The first line of defense is full and accurate reporting of all foreign relationships by U.S. university researchers to
                                                            their institution. This involves mandatory full disclosure of other financial support, when requested in proposal
                                                            submission must include any financial support received by the investigator from a foreign entity outside the US. This
                                                            disclosure includes support/funding received through contracts and grants through FAU or consultant, visiting scholar,
                                                            lecture or similar non-FAU appointment. For faculty on nine-month appointments, this requirement includes applicable
                                                            funds received from a non-FAU foreign entity for activities over the summer months.<br/><br/>
                                                            An issue of special concern is participation by U.S. universities in foreign talent programs, such as China’s Thousand
                                                            Talents Program, which the Pentagon has identified as an effort “to facilitate the legal and illicit transfer of US
                                                            technology, intellectual property and know-how” to China.<br/><br/>
                                                            The Division of Research is establishing a Task Force (or committee) to focus on foreign influence/threat, review
                                                            current policies and procedures to ensure compliance and develop an implementation plan for FAU. Members of this
                                                            committee will represent different interest groups across the university such as Provost’s office, OIT, HR and including
                                                            faculty researchers. The DOR is in the process of creating a webpage that will provide pertinent information and the
                                                            federal agencies notices. DOR will also be scheduling Town Hall meetings to further distribute information and guidance
                                                            related to this essential topic.<br/><br/>
                                                            All federal agencies are taking this issue very seriously. The best advice at this point is to be sure to disclose any
                                                            and all activities that involve a foreign entity. Thank you for giving your full attention to the critically important
                                                            issue of preventing foreign exploitation of U.S. research discoveries. Stay tuned for additional resources and

                                                    This memorandum serves as a reminder to the FAU research community that the Division of
                                                    Research (DoR) reviews all matters related to the conduct of University research. Allegations of
                                                    research misconduct (fabrication, falsification and plagiarism) are managed by a prescriptive
                                                    regulatory process that involves ad-hoc faculty committee peer review of the allegation(s). It is
                                                    the DoR’s charge to manage all such assessments, inquiries and investigations in accordance with
                                                    state and federal laws, regulations, and DoR Policy 10.1.1 <br/>
                                                    <br/>
                                                    The Vice President for Research is Florida Atlantic University’s Presidential designee and the
                                                    registered Institutional Official and Research Integrity Officer with the respective federal
                                                    regulatory agencies. Should faculty, staff or students have concerns related to the conduct of
                                                    research, such concerns should be brought to the attention of the DoR.<br/>
                                                    <br/>
                                                    The DoR has primary responsibility for managing the review of potential research misconduct, but
                                                    it discharges its responsibilities in coordination with other units of the University. For example, the
                                                    Provost is FAU’s designated Deciding Official who decides, in consultation with the Vice President
                                                    for Research, whether allegations of misconduct warrant an investigation and what actions are
                                                    appropriate upon a finding of misconduct. Additionally, before researchers may submit research
                                                    proposals to the DoR, it is required that the researcher’s college or unit review and approve the
                                                    following elements of any proposal: scientific merit, methodology, project personnel, feasibility
                                                    and resources (equipment and infrastructure) and other required necessities to successfully and
                                                    safely execute proposed research studies. Such review and approval prior to submission of
                                                    proposals should help minimize the potential for research misconduct.<br/>
                                                    <br/>
                                                    This coordination of its activities also places limits on the DoR’s institutional roles. For example,
                                                    the DoR does not have purview of matters related to academic impropriety or student discipline, or
                                                    to supervisory and personnel matters (except those relating to employees of the Division of
                                                    Research). The DoR is available to assist other units of the University in addressing such matters if
                                                    warranted, but it does not have primary responsibility in such instances except to the extent that
                                                    potential research misconduct is identified.
