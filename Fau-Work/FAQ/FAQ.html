                                                        examiner from the U.S. Patent &amp;Trademark Office (USPTO) to respond to an application. The response will either approve the application or reject it in the form of an Office Action. 
                                                        An application may receive an Office Action if the patent examiner argues that the application’s claims are not patentable over the “prior art” (any patents or other documents that were publicly 
                                                        disclosed before the subject application was filed). To overcome the examiner’s argument, outside counsel may file a written response to the Office Action amending the application’s claims and/or arguing why the patent examiner’s position is incorrect. This process is referred to 
                                                        as patent prosecution. Once the application is resolved, the patent examiner issues a Notice of Allowance that states that the USPTO has agreed to issue a patent.
