                        Foundation (FAUF)<br /></h2>
                    <p>
                        Foundations who provide funding often require that the submitting entity be designated as
                        tax-exempt by the IRS in order to be eligible for funding. FAU is designated as a 170c
                        tax-exempt entity and may apply for funding as a tax-exempt entity. <br /><br />
                        However, some Foundations may require that the submitting entity have the 501(c)3 tax-exempt
                        designation to be eligible. The FAU Foundation is a 501c3 tax-exempt entity. For those
                        foundations/sponsors that require the submitting institution have the 501c3 designation, the
                        grant proposal will be submitted through the Florida Atlantic University Foundation, Inc.
                        (FAUF). In most cases, proposals that do not require the designation of 501c3 will be submitted
                        through FAU. However, all grant proposals that will be submitted to Private Foundations a
                        notification should be sent to the Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations for three
                        reasons: to coordinate grant submissions with the OSP, to provide useful information about the
                        funder, and to ensure that priority-driven relationships are managed with the utmost
                        professionalism.<br /><br />
                        Regardless of the submitting entity, all grant proposals (research, instructional, program and
                        other sponsored grant activity) must be routed through the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP)
                        for review.<br /><br />
                        For those grant proposals submitted through the FAUF, the following procedures should be
                        followed:

                                work with the Principal Investigator (PI) on the grant proposal and all related
                                documents.<br /><br />
                                The PI (or designee) will contact the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) Proposal and
                                Contract Administrator (PCA) and e-mail a copy of the Letter of Inquiry and/or the
                                Request for Proposal (RFP) and any other document related to the submission.

                                review will be followed. These grant proposals will require coordination between the PI,
                                FAUF and OSP.
