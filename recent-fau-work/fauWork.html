His research program focuses on establishing new methodologies using organocatalysis, which will be directly applied in the total synthesis of complex targets. The total synthesis campaigns are gravitating around the development of innovative methodologies on chirality and peptide chemistry as tools for the preparation of complex non-proteinogenic amino acids, peptides, and alkaloids.

He is a physical chemist with a general interest in the use of optical spectroscopic techniques, particularly Raman spectroscopy (RS), to characterize the structure of biomolecules, living cells, and tissue. His laboratory has made original contributions to the development of RS as a method for detecting and characterizing non-melanoma skin cancers, and the use of RS to visualize cell-penetrating peptides in live melanoma cells. His laboratory also conducts research on cancer-related enzymes such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).

                                        Herbert Weissbach is an emeritus research professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. A major research interest of his laboratory has been in the role of oxidative damage in aging and age-related diseases, and more specifically the mechanisms that cells use to protect against oxidative damage. Recent work has focused on sulindac, a known NSAID, in protecting cells against oxidative damage. The Msr system reduces sulindac, a prodrug, to sulindac sulfide, an active COX inhibitor. However, sulindac has novel properties unrelated to its NSAID activity. It can initiate a protective preconditioning mechanism in normal cells similar to that observed in ischemic preconditioning. Of interest is the finding that cancer cells, unlike normal cells, are more sensitive to oxidative damage after treatment with sulindac.
