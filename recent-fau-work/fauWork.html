                        <p>
                            The roles of the Postdoctoral Fellow are crucial to the success of
                            Florida Atlantic University (FAU) research and economic
                            development programs. This policy outlines the responsibilities of
                            a postdoctoral fellow, addressing the job definition, length of
                            appointment, benefits and performance evaluation.

                            their responsibilities and provide metrics to assist the
                            university in reporting the number of employees holding this
                            position at FAU.

                        <p>
                            There are generally four appointment types for postdoctoral fellows:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The first type includes postdoctoral fellows primarily engaged
                                    in research and scholarship who are either funded by their
                                    advisor's grant and research funding, or with support from their
                                    own training grant. These postdoctoral fellows typically hold 12
                                    months positions.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The second type combines scholarship and research with classroom
                                    teaching and pedagogical development. Research activities in the
                                    first two types should be focused on the development of a future
                                    academic or professional career.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The third type is primarily concerned with teaching, with an
                                    emphasis on pedagogical and curricular development. The latter
                                    type typically runs in nine-months cycles throughout the
                                    academic year. The teaching load for this third type should not
                                    exceed a 3/3 load. Appointees should receive mentorship and
                                    formal training to expand their teaching repertoire.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The fourth type is focused on economic development. Entrepreneurial postdoctoral
                                    fellows
                                    prepare for a career in industry or private business. These fellows typically have
                                    developed a research idea during their graduate studies for which they envision a
                                    commercial product or application. During the first year(s), fellows will pursue
                                    their
                                    idea in a FAU affiliated research group with the head of this group acting as an
                                    academic mentor. While they may maintain some connection with the research lab,
                                    fellows
                                    will then transition to one of FAU’s entrepreneurial programs (preferably FAU Tech
                                    Runway) for the second stage of their postdoc. There they will receive mentorship
                                    that
                                    focuses on entrepreneurism, business development and management. The primary goal
                                    for an
                                    entrepreneurial postdoc is to take laboratory research toward application and
                                    commercialization.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            An appointee should be considered a collaborator of the faculty, and
                            thereby co-author appropriate research outcome; or an appointee may
                            pursue his/her own research under the guidance of a faculty, or a
                            combination of both.
                        </p>
                        <i>Responsibilities and Expectations</i>
                        <h4><u>Mentor</u></h4>
                        <p>The postdoctoral fellow should be supervised by a mentor who is a faculty member in the unit
                            or a
                            related unit to which the fellow has been assigned. Mentors are responsible for guiding,
                            monitoring and supporting the work of the fellow. The mentor has the responsibility of
                            contributing to the intellectual, technical and professional development of the fellow in a
                            meaningful way. At the time of the postdoc hire, the mentor should provide the fellow with a
                            written document outlining assigned duties and expectations. The fellow should also be
                            presented
                            with a description of goals for the training program. These should include career advice.

                            degree, e.g. PhD, MD, or equivalent. Candidates from no-US institutions must hold advanced
                            degrees equivalent to those awarded in US Institutions. It is the candidate’s responsibility
                            to
                            provide transcripts and/or diploma certifying degree completion. It is the mentor’s
                            responsibility to review this documentation and ensure that they are included in the
                            candidate’s
                            files. In no event will a postdoctoral fellow be appointed without the degree having been
                            awarded.<br /><br />
                            The appointment of a postdoctoral fellow/scholar is typically a 12-month assignment, for up
                            to
                            three years. Petitions to extend by up to three additional years for a total of six (6)
                            years
                            will be considered. Further extensions are only granted in extreme cases with considerable
                            justification. Upon the end date, the appointee will have no continued contractual
                            relationship
                            with the University.<br /><br />

            <h1>The University...at a Glance</h1>
            Some universities measure greatness in decades and centuries. Florida
            Atlantic University measures it with every student who earns a degree,
            every researcher who makes a discovery and every community that is
            transformed.<br /><br />At FAU's dedication ceremony in 1964, President
            Lyndon B. Johnson challenged the University's pioneers: "It is time
            now...for a new, adventurous, imaginative, courageous breakthrough for a
            new revolution in education in America."<br /><br />With those words, FAU
            opened its doors as the first public university in southeast Florida and
            the first in America designed for upper division students only. Since day
            one, FAU has pushed the bounds of higher education. Now, 50 years later,
            the University serves more than 30,000 freshmen, transfers and graduate
            students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast
            Florida.<br /><br />People from every walk of life find a place at FAU.
            Students choose from more than 170 degree programs, faculty researchers
            utilize more than 40 research centers and the community engages hundreds
            of cultural and educational events every year.
